            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It was not any ſuppoſed Worth in theſe <hi>Papers,</hi> which moved me to conſent to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
<pb facs="tcp:101081:3"/>of them. But becauſe our <hi>Romiſh Adverſaries</hi> had the confidence, openly to triumph in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (though I hope without ground,) as if their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion <hi>Maſter Dempſter,</hi> had left, not me only, (which had been no great matter,) but alſo the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANTS,</hi> at a great loſſe and diſadvantage. Who, Who am I, the meaneſt of the thouſands of <hi>ISRAEL,</hi> that any infirmities of mine, whether ſuppoſed or reall, ſhould be charged on ſo GLORIOUS a CAUSE, which is the invincible <hi>Truth</hi> of the Moſt High <hi>GOD,</hi> &amp; may bid a defyance to all the <hi>Goliahs</hi> and Hoaſts of <hi>Romiſh Philiſtins?</hi> Hath not the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> ſtood as an impregnable Rock againſt all the aſſaults both of <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick heads</hi> and <hi>bloody hands,</hi> which have been kept at worke theſe many years, in oppoſition thereto by the <hi>See of Rome?</hi> Who then, that is but one remove from madneſſe, can imagine that the inſignificant ſcufle of this <hi>Ieſuit</hi> ſhould endanger it? I freely confeſſe, what I have ſaid, or can ſay, is infinitly below the dignity of the CAUSE which I mantaine, yea, and exceedingly ſhort, of what eminent <hi>Lights</hi> in the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> have ſaid, and can further ſay in behalfe of our <hi>Religion.</hi> Muſt it not argue either height of prejudice, or pitifull ſhallowneſs, to impute whatſoever deficiencies of ſuch an one as Me, to <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf? Wherefore Reverend, Learned, Pious &amp; Iudicious Perſons, (with whome I did communicate all theſe Papers when they were exchanged,) have judged it ſit, that all ſhould be faithfully publiſhed, that the World might have a new demonſtration, on how ſmall grounds
<pb facs="tcp:101081:3"/>(to ſay no worſe,) our <hi>clamorous Romanists</hi> can triumph, as if they were more then conquerours. Well may that ſaying of <hi>Auſtin, in Pſalm.</hi> 32. Be accommodated to them, <hi>Non remanet iis niſi ſola infirmitas animoſitatis, quae tanto eſt languidior, quanto ſe majores vires habere aestimat. There only ſupport is, the infirmity of an high or overweening ſtomach, which is ſo much the more feeble, as it overvalueth its own ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been the uſuall artifice of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> when they could not conquer <hi>Truth</hi> by their captious argueings, to load the aſſertors thereof with reproaches. <hi>Auſtin</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of ſuch dealing, both from <hi>Paſcentius,</hi> a champion of the <hi>Arrians, tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Epist.</hi> 174. As alſo from the <hi>Donatiſts, tom.</hi> 7. <hi>in Epiſt. ad Donatiſt. post collat.</hi> What wonder then, though <hi>Romaniſts</hi> who are ſo <hi>Hereticall</hi> in their Doctrines, be Acted by the ſame Calumniating <hi>Genius?</hi> Learned <hi>Doctor Prideaux, lect.</hi> 9. <hi>de viſib. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> §. 11. Hath been at the paines to preſent his <hi>Reader</hi> with a multitude of inſtances of moſt impudent Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, wherewith <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have aſperſed faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of truth. I will not rake in that dung-hil. Only let me remember you, that <hi>Romiſh practiſes</hi> of this nature were long agoe ſo known to the World, that learned <hi>Doctor Featly,</hi> before that he and <hi>Doctor Francis Whyte,</hi> engaged in their diſput with <hi>Fiſher</hi> and <hi>Sweet, two Ieſuits,</hi> could eaſily preſage and foretell to the pitcher of the field, that whatever were the iſſue of that combat, and at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſadvantage the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> ſhould be left, yet he and his Colegue <hi>Doctor Whyte,</hi> ſhould be conquered <hi>in effigie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101081:4"/>and led in triumph in many a Pageant at <hi>Doway, Bruxels, Rhemes,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> as afterwards fell out. Yea ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent were the <hi>Romanists,</hi> that <hi>Doctor Weſton</hi> told at <hi>Sainct Omers,</hi> to a <hi>Proteſtant Lord,</hi> who had been preſent at the diſput, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Earle of Warwick,</hi> that the two <hi>Ieſuits</hi> had acquitted themſelves ſo admirably well, and with ſo much advantage to the <hi>Romiſh intereſt,</hi> that two <hi>Earles,</hi> and an hundreth <hi>Auditors</hi> were gained to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and of theſe <hi>Earles</hi> this noble <hi>Lord</hi> to whom the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſpake, was affirmed to be one; who could not but ſmyle as theſe ludibrious <hi>Legends.</hi> For the <hi>Earle</hi> well knew, there were not near an hunder perſons preſent at the <hi>Conference,</hi> nor one <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> ſtaggered thereby. Yea, the perſon for whoſe ſatisfaction that conference was principally intended, though before he had his own doubts, yet after the debate, profeſſed that he was fully reſolved as to the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi> All this is teſtified by judicious <hi>Doctor Featly,</hi> in the Relation of that <hi>Conference.</hi> Should it then ſeem ſtrange to any, that the triſting debate wherein I have been lately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with this <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> hath been ſo groſly miſrepreſented by men of theſe principles? Who could have expected any thing elſe? <hi>Doe men gather grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles?</hi> Yet as to my own particular intereſt, I could have borne all their reproaches, remembring that of the <hi>Ancient, Quiſquis volens detrahit famae meae, nolens addit mercedi meae.</hi> But judicious Lovers of <hi>Truth</hi> finding <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> it ſelf to be thruſt at through my ſides, laid bonds upon me to give the World a faithfull account of that
<pb facs="tcp:101081:4"/>whole tranſaction; though otherwiſe, I could willingly have deſtined theſe poor <hi>Papers,</hi> ſo farre as they concerned me, to perpetuall ſilence.</p>
            <p>Since therefore, <hi>Very Honorable,</hi> this ſcufle with <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Dempſter</hi> fell out under the intuition of your <hi>Authority,</hi> I judged it incumbent to me, to preſent you with this brief enſuing account thereof. As you in your <hi>Civil Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> and we your <hi>Miniſters</hi> in our <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Lyne,</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to ſuppreſſe <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Vngodlyneſſe</hi> in this <hi>CITY,</hi> We had frequent opportunity to deal with Perſons of a <hi>Popiſh perſwaſion.</hi> When we did demonſtrate to them that the preſent <hi>Romiſh Religion</hi> was <hi>Falſe, Impious, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous</hi> yea, and (notwithſtanding all its high pretences to <hi>Catholiciſm,</hi>) groſly <hi>Schiſmatical.</hi> Theſe poor ſtraying Soules, being nuzled up in ignorance by their <hi>Romiſh Guides,</hi> under a pretence of the <hi>Implicit Colliar Faith,</hi> could make little other <hi>Reply,</hi> then that, though they could not anſwere us, yet there <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Learned Men</hi> could argue the matter to the full.

            <p>Within a few dayes hereafter, when the <hi>Secret contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> (as ſeemes,) was ryp, and <hi>Master Dempster</hi> with much ſtudy had put his <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> into its <hi>goodly frame,</hi> and committed it to writing, (only the miſery was, that he forgot to ſtudy the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of either of the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi> thereof,) the <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> of whom I was lately ſpeaking, accompanyed by another of that Profeſſion, was pleaſed on the 18. of <hi>Aprile</hi> 1666: to make Me a viſit, my <hi>Reverend &amp; Learned Colegue, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>
               </hi> GEORGE MELDRUM being then with Me. He did beſpeake us both to this purpoſe. <hi>You may remember,</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>that you have ſaid in conference with perſons of our Profeſsion, that you would not ſhunne to argue the Controverſies of Religion with any of our Learned Men, and now you may have opportunity of a free
<pb facs="tcp:101081:6"/>communing with a Catholick Scholer</hi> (ſo the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,) <hi>at my Lodging, if you be pleaſed to goe along with Me.</hi> We anſwered, that we were not unmindful of what we ſaid, and ſhould be as ready through the help of GOD to performe, whenſoever occaſion did offer. But I behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt to anſwere another <hi>challenge</hi> ſent by him to Me; ſome dayes befor, as if I had wronged <hi>Popiſh Authours</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the <hi>Doctrine of Repentance.</hi> And therefore, I offered pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to make good what I had affirmed as to that thing, by produceing their own <hi>Authours.</hi> But he would not ſo much as ſpeake to that particular: Only he inſiſted u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the other <hi>Propoſition.</hi> Whereupon we told that we ſhould never decline a communing, either upon that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or any other <hi>Question of Religion</hi> with any perſon whatſoever. But becauſe ſuch <hi>Conferences</hi> might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly miſrepreſented, it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ul that <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> were cautiouſly ordered. It was therefore agreed upon by mutual conſent, that there ſhould be none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but <hi>ſix of either ſide,</hi> and all to be ſilent except the <hi>Diſputants.</hi> Yea, the <hi>ſix</hi> which ſhould be of the <hi>Popiſh ſide,</hi> were by name expreſſed. The day being now farre ſpent, and the advertiſeing of our Friends requiring a time; it was alſo condeſcended, that our <hi>meeting</hi> ſhould be to morrow in the afternoon, at this <hi>Gentle-Mans Lodging.</hi> When we had given notice to ſome diſcreet Perſons of <hi>Our Religion,</hi> concerning this <hi>challenge,</hi> they looked upon the <hi>place</hi> as unfit, upon many accounts. Wherefore I wrote a letter, deſiring the meeting might be at ſome other <hi>place,</hi> eſpecially, where <hi>bookes</hi> might be at
<pb facs="tcp:101081:6"/>hand, if any <hi>testimony</hi> which we cited ſhould be denyed. But when we were ſo far from obtaining this, that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire was interpreted, as if we were declyning the <hi>Conference,</hi> and diſtruſting our <hi>CAUSE.</hi> We reſolved to goe to the <hi>Gentle-Mans houſe</hi> upon whatſoever diſadvantage, take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with us no more then the <hi>definit number of Perſons</hi> eondeſcended upon. When we came into the <hi>Lodging,</hi> we found (contrary to promiſe,) a great multitude of <hi>both Sexes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Champion</hi> (whom we afterwards underſtood to be <hi>Mr. Dempster Ieſuit,</hi>) being ſet in a great <hi>Chair</hi> at the head of the Table, and a <hi>Popiſh Youth,</hi> who had been educated at the <hi>Scots College in Paris</hi> at his elbow; as a <hi>Scrivener,</hi> (who was none of the <hi>Perſons</hi> communed upon,) we complained of violation of <hi>promiſe,</hi> in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to ſuch a <hi>publick Convention,</hi> which in the end prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tumultuary, The clamours of the <hi>Excommunicated Women</hi> being louder then the <hi>Ieſuits Arguments.</hi> The <hi>Ieſuit</hi> anſwered, <hi>that was but a circumſtance.</hi> But it was <hi>replyed</hi> to him, that <hi>PROTESTANTS</hi> had too many dear bought experiences of the <hi>Perfidy</hi> of <hi>Papiſts.</hi> If they were not faithful in <hi>Circumstances,</hi> we had cauſe to jealous them much more in <hi>Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This paſſing. I publickly declared before all preſent, that I had received from ſuch a <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> two <hi>Challenges,</hi> One, as if I had charged upon <hi>Popiſh Doctors</hi> eoncerning <hi>Repentance</hi> that which they doe not mantaine. The Other, to debate the <hi>Controverſies of Religion</hi> with this perſon, who appeared as <hi>Champion</hi> for the <hi>Romiſh intereſt;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101081:7"/>Which my Reverend <hi>Colegue</hi> and I were ready to doe, not againſt him only, but againſt the whole <hi>Conclave</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> if there preſent. As to the <hi>first,</hi> I repeated to the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> what I had charged upon many of the chief <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Preſent Romiſh Church,</hi> concerning the <hi>Doctrine of Repentance, viz</hi> that they mantaine, <hi>That when a man hath ſinned haynouſly he is not bound to repent preſently.</hi> And required him, as one whom I preſumed to be acquaint with their writings, to declare, whether it was ſo or not? And if he would deny it, I offered inſtantly to prove it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. <hi>The Ieſuit anſwered he came not either to anſwere Queſtions, or Objections against the Romiſh Religion; but only to impugne the PROTESTANT Religion.</hi> It was <hi>Replyed</hi> to him, we were not affrayed of his <hi>Impugnations,</hi> but matters behoved to be managed <hi>orderly.</hi> The <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> which we profeſſe, being not only the <hi>Truth of GOD,</hi> but alſo eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Law of the Land;</hi> We could not betray our Truſt, by ſuffering it <hi>only,</hi> or in the <hi>first place</hi> to be impugned. But he ſhould have all, which in <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Iuſtice</hi> could be deſired. Let him anſwere us either <hi>two</hi> or <hi>ſix Arguments</hi> againſt <hi>Poperie,</hi> we ſhould anſwere as many propounded by him againſt the <hi>Religion of PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS.</hi> And this previous <hi>queſtion concerning Repentance,</hi> being of a <hi>matter of fact,</hi> might ſoon be at an end. So as not to impede the <hi>General diſcuſs</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> But the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> peremptorly inſiſted upon his <hi>Declinatur, That he would anſwere nothing, neither Queſtion nor Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only impugne</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it pleaſed a <hi>Grave &amp; Iudicious Perſon,</hi> who lately
<pb facs="tcp:101081:7"/>before had born Principal Charge in the <hi>Magiſtracie</hi> of this <hi>Town,</hi> G. G. P. (whom we found in the <hi>Lodging</hi> with others at our coming,) to interpoſe himſelf thus. <hi>I am a PROTESTANT</hi> (ſaid he,) <hi>nor have I any ſcruple concerning my Religion, yet I could willingly hear the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion fairly debated. But I cannot be witneſſe to have the</hi> PROTESTANT <hi>Religion only called in question, or in the firſt place. But it ſeemes a moſt just and reaſonable propoſal which is made, that ſo many objections be first moved againſt the Popiſh Religion, and then as many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Religion of</hi> PROTESTANTS. This the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> pertinaciouſly declyned, ſtil affirming that he would only impugne. Whereupon our PROTESTANT <hi>Friends</hi> thought it was fitteſt for us to be gone. And indeed we were once at the door removing, untill theſe of his own <hi>Party</hi> being aſhamed of his tergiverſing, perſwaded him at length by their importunity firſt to be <hi>Reſpondent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We returning, (and the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> ſhunning to debate with my <hi>Reverend and Learned Colegue Master</hi> GEORGE MELDRUM who had offered to impugne him,) the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> was againe deſired, <hi>Firſt</hi> to <hi>Anſwere</hi> to the <hi>Queſtion of fact,</hi> concerning the <hi>Doctrine of Repentance,</hi> and then <hi>Arguments</hi> of more general concernment ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. But he refuſeing to anſwere to that <hi>queſtion,</hi> unleſſe it were framed into an <hi>Argument</hi> againſt <hi>their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> I told that for gaining of time. I would frame it into an <hi>Argument</hi> againſt <hi>their Religion,</hi> though it would oblige Me to a more <hi>general accuſation</hi> of <hi>their Church,</hi> as to that <hi>particular,</hi> then I had delivered in the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> Yet
<pb facs="tcp:101081:8"/>to extort an <hi>Anſwere</hi> from him I would doe it, hoping afterwards to have liberty granted, to propound other <hi>Arguments</hi> againſt their <hi>Impious,</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous Religion.</hi> The <hi>Theſis</hi> which I undertooke to prove, was,
<q>That the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion is Impious.</q> My firſt <hi>Argument</hi> was framed after this manner:
<q>
                  <p>The Religion which teacheth, that when a man hath ſinned haynouſly, he is not bound to repent preſently, is Impious.</p>
                  <p>But the Popiſh Religion teacheth, that when a man hath ſinned haynouſly, he is not bound to repent preſently.</p>
                  <p>Ergo, the Popiſh Religion is Impious.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After that this <hi>Argument</hi> was ſeveral times repeated to the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> he denyed the <hi>Major.</hi> Whereupon I tooke Witneſſe of all that were preſent, but eſpecially of the <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> who had ſent the <hi>challenge</hi> to Me, that the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> had admitted the <hi>Minor, viz. That the Popiſh Religion teacheth, that when a man hath ſinned haynouſly, he is not bound to repent preſently</hi> (Which was the only thing which I intended to have cleared by this <hi>Argument,</hi> and was more then I had affirmed in <hi>Pulpit,</hi> of that <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>) And that he only denyed the <hi>Major, that it is an Impiety to teach ſo.</hi> Then I would have been at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of a new <hi>Argument.</hi> Had not he and that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as ſeemes to drive of time, and to keep Me from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding other <hi>Arguments</hi> againſt their Religion, by
<pb facs="tcp:101081:8"/>their clamorous outcrying, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained me to inſiſt on that which I never intended, namely, <hi>The confirmation of the Major,</hi> which of it ſelf, might ſeem evident enough to any who had any <hi>ſenſe of Godlyneſſe.</hi> It would be too tedious in this <hi>Epistolar diſcourſe,</hi> to rehearſe to your HONOURS all that was ſaid in <hi>Confirmation</hi> of that <hi>Major.</hi> Only I ſhall briefly relate to you the Reſult of it. The <hi>Ieſuit</hi> in end was reduced to ſay, <hi>That when a mans Soul, or Body, or his Neighbours Soul are in extreme danger, he is not bound preſently to take care of any of them.</hi> Which whether it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> intelligent Chriſtians may judge? Yea ſome of the Hearers, who were not called by us (ſpeaking of that buſines,) could make no better <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Romiſh intereſt,</hi> then to ſay, <hi>That the Ieſuit behaved himſelf like one who reſolved to betray the Romiſh Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then I propounded another <hi>Argument,</hi> which indeed was the <hi>firſt</hi> that I deſigned againſt their <hi>Religion,</hi> (the former being only occaſionally put into a <hi>Syllogiſtick frame</hi> to extort an anſwere from him, in reference to the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> whereof I had been challenged,) after this manner.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Religion which deſtroyeth all certainty of Faith, is Impious.</p>
               <p>But the Popiſh Religion deſtroyeth all certainty of Faith.</p>
               <p>Ergo, the Popiſh Religion is Impious.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Though the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> would make no <hi>Anſwere</hi> at all to this <hi>Argument,</hi> yet I propoſed a <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101081:9"/>(which was the only <hi>propoſition,</hi> which he could deny,) from the <hi>Tridentin</hi> and <hi>Florentin Canons,</hi> which make <hi>the efficacy of all Sacraments to depend upon the intention of the Prieſts who officiat.</hi> From which it followeth, that ſeeing they cannot have <hi>Certainty of Faith</hi> concerning the <hi>Prieſts intention,</hi> all <hi>certainty of Faith</hi> muſt be overturned in their <hi>Religion.</hi> They cannot certainly know who is <hi>Pope, Biſhop,</hi> or <hi>Prieſt,</hi> (<hi>Ordination</hi> with them being a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>) or who is <hi>Baptiſed;</hi> and conſequently, they cannot know who is capable to be a Conſtituent member of a <hi>Council,</hi> or to celebrat the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have certainty of Faith, that their <hi>Hoſty</hi> is <hi>tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated,</hi> even according to their own Principles, of that they have either <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> on whoſe Authority to build their Faith. To this <hi>Argument,</hi> the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> refuſed abſolutly to anſwere, deſiring that he might have liberty to impugne. But it was replyed to him, that my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was already tabled, to which if he would anſwere, I ſhould anſwere him other <hi>two</hi> according to my firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. And this was ſo much the more reaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my <hi>firſt Argument,</hi> as I ever declared, was only to extort a declaration from him, concerning a <hi>matter of fact.</hi> Sundry alſo of our PROTESTANT <hi>Friends,</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe advice, I reſolved not to move in a matter of ſuch publick concernment,) adviſed that I ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no Arguments from him, unleſſe he would anſwer this Argument which I had laſt propoſed. But ſtill he perſiſted in his Refuſal to anſwere my Argument. Whereupon it was told him, neither would I admit of any
<pb facs="tcp:101081:9"/>from him, untill that which I had propounded were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Yet had he been very zealous to impugne, might he not at leſt have vocally propounded his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?</hi> Did I not propound a <hi>ſecond Argument</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and hint alſo at the <hi>confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> which might have been queſtioned, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to anſwere thereto? Could I ſtop his mouth, more then he could mine? All he did was to hold a Paper in his hand, (wherein it ſeemes, he had his poor naked <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi>) and to call upon the <hi>Scrivener</hi> to writ. But he never told what ſhould be writen. It is generally ſuppoſed, and I believe truely, that the <hi>Paper</hi> which the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> had in his hand, was the <hi>First Paper</hi> which he tranſmitted to me the next night, and is in my <hi>Reply</hi> thereunto, I hope ſufficiently examined. It reſembled every way his <hi>firſt Paper,</hi> which I have by me, and it is more then probable that his <hi>firſt aſſault</hi> would be with that long ſtudyed <hi>Achilles,</hi> eſpecially, ſeeing in all his following Papers he could never frame one <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> more.</p>
            <p>Matters being at this point, the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> ſaid he would ſend a <hi>writen Paper</hi> to me, which I told him, by the help of GOD, ſhould be anſwered. Hereupon theſe enſuing <hi>Papers</hi> betwixt him and me were exchanged, which I ſhall ſubmit to the candid cenſure of the <hi>unprejudiced Reader.</hi> Only the <hi>tenth</hi> and <hi>laſt Paper</hi> was not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmitted to him, the occaſion whereof was this. Shortly after the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> ſent to me his <hi>tenth Paper,</hi> dated <hi>May</hi> 14 1667. He got out of the <hi>Nation.</hi> A <hi>Reply</hi> to it was lying
<pb facs="tcp:101081:10"/>drawn by me in <hi>Iune</hi> 1667. And when I was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tranſmit it to him, ſeverall Perſons did advertiſe me that he was gone over Sea; yet, as afterwards I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they made the rumour to goe, that he was gone, ſometime before he was really gone, to make me (as ſeemes,) lay aſide thoughts of returning an anſwere to his <hi>Tenth Paper.</hi> I thereupon deſired to be advyſed by judicious Friends, what was fit to be done in ſuch an exigent; whoſe judgements did all harmoniouſly concurre in this, that all the <hi>Papers</hi> ſhould be <hi>Printed,</hi> together with a <hi>Reply</hi> to his <hi>tenth Paper,</hi> that the World might have a full account of this whole Encounter, which had been ſo much noyſed abroad. Though I had a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation from appearing in Print, eſpecially, with ſuch <hi>trifling Papers,</hi> yet in end the Importunity and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Friends prevailed. And the rather becauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> made afterwards rumours ſometime to goe that <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Dempſter</hi> was dead, ſomtime that he was alive, ſo that I could not certainly know what was become of him. But whether he were liveing or dead, the <hi>Miſrepreſentations</hi> of this matter were ſtill animated by the calumniating <hi>Genius</hi> of living <hi>Papists,</hi> for confutation whereof, their clamours laid a neceſſity upon me, to publiſh faithfully the <hi>Papers</hi> exchanged betwixt us.</p>
            <p>There be ſome two or three things in theſe <hi>Papers</hi> which perhaps may ſeem to require an <hi>Apology.</hi> As <hi>firſt,</hi> It may be offenſive to ſome that there ſhould be ſo much writing on ſo little purpoſe. This can be no more irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to a <hi>Reader,</hi> then it was tedious to me in writing.
<pb facs="tcp:101081:10"/>But the nauſeating <hi>repetitions</hi> of the <hi>Adverſary</hi> conſtrained me either to reſume the ſame things, or to diſdaine to give him any <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Yet whether I have not given to him a large enough field, had he had courage to adventure out of his trenches, others may cognoſce. This I confeſſe was one of my tentations to chaſtiſe him ſome-what ſharply. leaſt peradventure I might afterwards be judged <hi>Socius Criminis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may <hi>Secondly</hi> be enquired, why I was not as ſpeedy at all times in my Anſweres to him, as he was to me. I believe the frequent incumbency's of duty which <hi>your HONOURS</hi> know dee weekly return on me, in <hi>School</hi> and <hi>Pulpit,</hi> might ſufficiently apologiz for me in this matter. But I have this further to adde. At the firſt, upon expectation of ſome ſignificancy from the <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> I concerned my ſelf to uſe ſome diligence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning my <hi>Papers,</hi> I believe not inferiour to him, though I had more to doe. But afterwards when <hi>I</hi> found nothing but frothy emptineſſe in his ſcriblings, it became a <hi>Probleme</hi> with me, whether to anſwere him at all. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I would purpoſly throw by his Papers for a time. But leſt my utter ſilence ſhould make him overvalue what he had ſaid, I would at a ſpare houre, mould him an anſwere. When I thought of the diſpatch he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed, (though yet ſundry of his Papers be antedated a conſiderable time before they were delivered to me,) it brought to my minde the ſtory of the conceited <hi>Painter,</hi> who bringing a Picture to <hi>Apelles,</hi> to raiſe the eſteeme of his Artifice, told that he had done it in ſo ſhort a time.

            <p>There is a <hi>Third exception,</hi> which may be taken at the acrimony vvhich <hi>I</hi> have uſed in ſome of theſe <hi>Papers.</hi> I ſincerely profeſſe, <hi>I</hi> take no pleaſure therein. <hi>I</hi> love rather hard <hi>Arguments</hi> then hard <hi>Words.

I believe no diſcreet Perſon will aſcribe this appearance in <hi>Print</hi> to vanity: For I acknowledge the <hi>debate</hi> is inglorious, the <hi>Papers</hi> which I had to examine, being ſo very inſignificant. I may indeed be blamed for waſting Oyle and Paines to confute ſuch <hi>triſtes.</hi> But <hi>Mr. Dempſter,</hi> and what dropped from his mouth or pen, how frivolous ſo ever, were ſo admired, (I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid, adored,) by our <hi>Romiſh Apoſtats,</hi> that, had I not anſwered him, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed both his <hi>Papers</hi> and mine, I ſhould have been judged by many as wanting in duty to the PROTESTANT <hi>Intereſt.</hi> Who in ſuch an exigence, would not rather ſubmit to have his labour cenſured as unneceſſary, then to be deemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to the <hi>Truth?</hi>

From the <hi>manifold and groſſe Idolatry</hi> eſtabliſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
<pb facs="tcp:101081:13"/>4. From its <hi>Contrariety to Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and the <hi>Schiſmatical conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>preſent Romiſh Church,</hi> though <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have the confidence to glory, as if they were the only <hi>Catholicks.</hi> 5. From the <hi>Impious reproaches,</hi> which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and the <hi>Preſent Romiſh Religion</hi> doe throw upon the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> 6.

But finding that theſe Papers had ſwelled to ſuch a bigneſſe, I thought fit to wave the foreſaid par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars at the time, and the rather, all theſe being judiciouſly handled by Perſons of eminent <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Piety.</hi> Yet if I be providentially drawn to a further proſecution of this <hi>debate,</hi> I may then perhaps reſume ſome thoughts of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>I could willingly have deleted <hi>ſome ſmart expreſſions,</hi> which the unhandſome dealing of the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> extorted from me. If I know my own <hi>genius,</hi> I take no pleaſure in <hi>Altercations.</hi> I would rather contend with an <hi>Adverſary</hi> in <hi>civilities.</hi> It hath often been My deſyre, if at any time I ſhould be engaged in a <hi>Polemick debate,</hi> that it might be My lot, to deale with an <hi>Ingenuous perſon,</hi> who laying aſide perſonal <hi>Criminations,</hi> cowardly <hi>preteritions,</hi> and Childiſh <hi>tautologies,</hi> would fairly and yet vigorouſly proſecut the <hi>debate,</hi> which would be both recreative to <hi>Diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:101081:13"/>give a real acount of what had paſſed. Wherefore theſe <hi>unpoliſhed lines,</hi> muſt ſuffer the fate of going abroad in their Homelie and Native dreſſe, as they firſt dropped from me, <hi>currente calamo,</hi> without <hi>Alteration, Addition,</hi> or <hi>Diminution,</hi> ſo farre as could be attained by <hi>ordinary moral diligence.</hi> I muſt adde this <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> leſt a <hi>Litigious Adverſary</hi> ſhould object to me any petty eſcape, either of the <hi>preſſe,</hi> or <hi>Amanuenſis.</hi> For other alteration they have ſuffered none.</p>
            <p>I ſtudyed ſuch faithfulneſſe in tranſcribing my <hi>papers,</hi> that I have not ſo much as <hi>engliſhed</hi> one ſentence which was not <hi>engliſhed</hi> in the <hi>original papers</hi> tranſmitted to the <hi>Ieſuit.</hi> Albeit the <hi>engliſhing</hi> of ſundry <hi>teſtimonies,</hi> would have rendered the <hi>papers</hi> more grateful and more uſeful to many <hi>Reader.</hi> The like <hi>Iuſtice</hi> I have done to the <hi>Ieſuits papers.</hi> For what ever be the <hi>Tenet</hi> of <hi>Romaniſts, De fide non ſervanda Haereticis,</hi> yet we PROTESTANTS hold it a cryme to deale unjuſtly with an <hi>Enemy,</hi> with an <hi>Heretick,</hi> yea, with a <hi>Ieſuit.</hi> There is no <hi>Alteration</hi> wittingly made upon either word or ſentence of any of his <hi>papers,</hi> ſafe only that the PRIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER hath been at the paines to correct many of the groſſer treſpaſſes in their <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy.</hi> He craves pardon for ſome few errours <hi>which</hi> have eſcaped him, ſuch as page 80. line 14 GGD for GOD, and page 179. line 6. moir for mor. But for theſe two <hi>unwilling eſcapes,</hi> (and if there be any more of that kinde,) he hath corrected many more then fourty times two <hi>groſſe errours,</hi> which one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how they had dropped from the penne of a profeſſed <hi>Scholer.</hi> The PRINTER judged not himſelf obliged to correct all. So that ſundry abſurd errours doe yet remaine by which thou mayeſt gueſſe, what papers thou ſhould have had, if no correction had been uſed. I may ſincerly ſay by this <hi>Edition,</hi> I have neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my own <hi>papers,</hi> nor wronged the <hi>Ieſuits.</hi> Nay <hi>the Ieſuits</hi> have received a conſiderable advantage by the correction of many <hi>Orthographick treſpaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible of one <hi>diſadvantage</hi> I ſtand at, in regard, <hi>the Ieſuit</hi> could never be induced to ſigne any of his <hi>papers,</hi> though ofter then once he was required to doe it. I might juſtly have diſdained to notice his <hi>papers,</hi> as not carrying the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Authour.</hi> And the rather, ſeeing <hi>Their Councal of Trent ſeſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>decret.</hi> 2. had prohibited the publiſhing or diſſeminating any <hi>papers on a Religious ſubject, quoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis libros de rebus ſacris ſine nomine Authoris, without the name of the Authour,</hi> and that <hi>Sub paena Anathematts.</hi> But ſuch noyſe was made here of the <hi>papers</hi> of this <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> as if ſome new <hi>Goliah</hi> had appeared, or a new monſtrous <hi>Sphinx,</hi> for the unravelling of whoſe <hi>Riddles,</hi> hardly the World could afford an <hi>OEdipus.</hi> So that I was conſtrained to take ſome notice of them, under whatſoever <hi>Irregularity</hi> they did appeare. Yet now, when the nakedneſſe of their <hi>Idol</hi> is diſcovered to the World, perhaps <hi>Our Romaniſts</hi> may affirme that theſe are not <hi>the Ieſuits papers,</hi> or that they are interpolated or vitiated, and ſo much the rather, becauſe they know that I have them not ſubſcribed with the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> hand. This inconvenient I ſmelled how ſoon I received his <hi>Firſt paper,</hi> and ſignified ſo much to him in the cloſe of <hi>My Anſweres</hi> to his <hi>firſt, ſecond,</hi> and <hi>third papers;</hi> but by no meanes could he be drawn to <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> any of them: yea poſitively he declined it towards the
<pb facs="tcp:101081:14"/>end of his <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>third papers.</hi> But now, ſhould <hi>Our Romaniſts</hi> betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this <hi>ſubterfuge,</hi> they will but diſcover more of their <hi>diſingenuity.</hi> For I ſincerely profeſſe, I have given in the <hi>faithful Copies</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuits papers</hi> to the <hi>Preſſe.</hi> And in verification hereof, I can produce the <hi>Authentick copies</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me by the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> to which theſe here exhibited in <hi>Print</hi> are conforme. Though the <hi>papers</hi> ſent to me be <hi>unſubſcribed,</hi> yet they were ſeen at the time of their tranſmiſſion, by <hi>Eminent Perſons</hi> of <hi>Our Religion,</hi> who can atteſt theſe to be the <hi>papers</hi> which I received. I believe alſo, they were comunicated by him to many <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who if they will deale ingenuouſly, cannot but acknowledge that theſe are the <hi>Faithful Copies</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuits papers</hi> which are here ſet forth.</p>
            <p>I am not ſo vain, as to deſire that any <hi>Romaniſt</hi> ſhould inſiſt in this <hi>debate.</hi> I take no Complacency in <hi>Eriſtique debates,</hi> further then <hi>the Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> on that account doe conſtraine me. I wiſh there were no <hi>Controverſies</hi> about <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi> I would reckon it a greater Mercy to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of GOD to contribut my poor <hi>mite,</hi> for the healing of breaches, (were it poſſible,) then to write as <hi>vaſt voleums</hi> of <hi>Controverſies,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine, Stapleton, Gretſer,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>Pax una triumphis</hi>

            </p>
            <p>May I therefore earneſtly obteſt the more <hi>Moderat Romaniſts,</hi> (for I have no hope of prevailing with the <hi>Ieſuited faction,</hi> whoſe deſigne, as appeares, is to keep up a <hi>ſtated Schiſine</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and to ruin by <hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Force</hi> all who cannot comply with their miſchievous <hi>Projects,</hi>) ſeriouſly to conſider, whether there be not many things in the <hi>preſent Popiſh Religion,</hi> greatly obſtructive to the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>the Catholick Church.</hi> I ſhall but hint at a few things. As <hi>firſt,</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> whether Pope, or <hi>Council,</hi> or both. Will <hi>the Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> admit of <hi>Reformation</hi> ſo long as ſhe affirmes her ſelf to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond poſſibilitie of <hi>erring? Secondly, The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Supremacy</hi> acclaimed by <hi>the Pope</hi> over <hi>the Catholick Church.</hi> Doth not this oblige <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to keep up a <hi>Schiſme</hi> from all theſe <hi>Churches,</hi> which cannot enſlave themſelves to this <hi>

As if they would rather have people turne <hi>Scepticks,</hi> or <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> then remaine <hi>PROTESTANTS.</hi> Have not many <hi>Romaniſts</hi> had many convictions in their conſciences, that there are corruptions in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> calling aloud for <hi>Reformation?</hi> in ſo-much that there have been many meetings at <hi>Rome</hi> of their <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> in order to this? But well did <hi>Luther,</hi> as <hi>Sleidan</hi> reports <hi>lib.</hi> 12. <hi>ad Annum</hi> 1537. compare theſe <hi>Aſſemblyes,</hi> to a company of <hi>Foxes,</hi> comeing to ſweep a room full of duſt with their tailes. And in ſtead of ſweeping out the duſt, they ſweept it all about the houſe, and made a great ſmoke for a while, but when they were gone, the duſt fell down againe. How long ſhall <hi>Romaniſts</hi> through Pride, prejudice, faction and intereſt, ſtifle theſe convictions?</p>
            <p>Yet if any <hi>Romaniſt</hi> will needs proſecute this <hi>debate,</hi> I cannot be ſo baſe, being honoured to ſtand for ſo GLORIOUS a CAUSE, as to fear what any <hi>Mortal</hi> can ſay. I know there are <hi>Learned Romaniſts,</hi> who can ſay much more for their ill cauſe, then <hi>Mr. Dempſter</hi> hath done. They want neither <hi>Learning</hi> nor <hi>Policy</hi> to ſupport their <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>iniquity.</hi> So that (as <hi>Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win Sands</hi> hath judiciouſly obſerved, in his <hi>Speculum Europae, page</hi> 24.) <hi>were it not for the Natural weakenes of untruth and Diſhoneſty, which being rotten at the heart, doeth abate the force of what ever is founded thereon, there outward means were ſufficient to ſubdue a whole World.</hi> But it concerns <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to notice the ſmart admonition which <hi>Auſtine</hi> gave to a <hi>Learned Heathen, Ornari a te quaerit Diabolus.</hi> How will theſe men render an account of their Talents one day, who emprove them to promot the Devils intereſt? I ſhould be a very great ſtranger to my ſelf, if I were not conſcious to my own weakeneſſe. Yet <hi>Truth</hi> hath ſuch advantage over <hi>Errour,</hi> that it doth not need <hi>Advocats</hi> of the greateſt Learning or profoundeſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let me only therefore leave theſe <hi>Advertiſements</hi> to him who will be at the paines to make a <hi>Reply,</hi> whether <hi>Mr. Dempſter,</hi> who, as I heare, is alive againe, or any other: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he hath not only the <hi>tenth and laſt paper</hi> to <hi>anſwere,</hi> but alſo to ſupply the <hi>paralipomena</hi> or <hi>emiſsions</hi> of all his former <hi>papers,</hi> &amp; ſo in truth he hath the whole <hi>Ten</hi> to examine. 2. It will not be very handſome to catch at broken ſhreds here or there. But if he would doe his worke throughly, he muſt diſcuſſe all, and chiefly that which is moſt material.

<pb facs="tcp:101081:15"/>
               <hi>Mr. Dempſters papers,</hi> which I have not reviſed? 3. I deſire that he would not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to me the ordinarie <hi>cavils of Romaniſts,</hi> unleſſe he will be at the paines to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what is Replyed thereto by our <hi>Divines.</hi> Elſe he will conſtraine me, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to neglect what he ſayes, or to remit him to the <hi>Authours</hi> who have canvaſed theſe <hi>Objections</hi> before, or at moſt to tranſcribe <hi>old Anſweres</hi> given to theſe <hi>old objections,</hi> which cannot but be allowable in me who am the <hi>Defendant.</hi> This I the rather have mentioned, becauſe it is obſerved, that late <hi>Romiſh Pamphleters</hi> doe often reſume <hi>old Objections</hi> without mentioning the <hi>Anſweres</hi> made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by our <hi>Divines,</hi> as if they were <hi>New Arguments,</hi> and hitherto unheard of. Thus they abuſe many of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> who are not verſed in <hi>great volumes,</hi> eſpecially, in the <hi>Latine tongue,</hi> where all theſe <hi>Sophiſms</hi> are ſolidly confuted. 4. He may be pleaſed to owne what he writes, by putting his <hi>Name</hi> thereto. I cannot be obliged to fight any longer <hi>cum Larvis,</hi> with <hi>Specters,</hi> who have not the confidence to owne what they write. 5. And <hi>laſtly,</hi> I hope it would not be amiſſe that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal criminations</hi> were laid aſide. <hi>Mr. Dempſter</hi> extorted more <hi>Recriminations</hi> from me then I had pleaſure in, but if I meet with a <hi>Civil Adverſary, I</hi> hope he ſhall have no cauſe to complaine of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncivility</hi> from me. But if he will needs thruſt more at me then at the <hi>CA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE,</hi> I can rejoyce with <hi>Hierom</hi> to be railed u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and with <hi>Job, chap.</hi> 31. <hi>verſe</hi> 36. <hi>Take theſe</hi> invectives <hi>on my ſhoulder and bind them to me as a Crown.</hi> It was an <hi>Heroick</hi> word of <hi>Luther, Indies magis mihi placeo, ſuperbus fio, quod video nomen peſsimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mihi creſcere.</hi> He gloryed in it that he was evil ſpoken of for a good cauſe. If theſe <hi>rational propoſals</hi> be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, I will not contend, in that <hi>Caſe,</hi> for the laſt word, <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Silence</hi> wil, I hope, ſufficiently then apologize for me.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Objection</hi> muſt needs be removed. It may be asked how I doe charge <hi>the Ieſuit, as declyning to have the truth of Religion either examined by Scripture or Antiquity,</hi> ſeeing he profers at leſt to have one <hi>Controverſie</hi> examined by <hi>Scripture, Viz. concerning the number of Sacraments?</hi> But let any rational perſon though a <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> if he can but diſpoſſeſſe his own mind of prejudice, cognoſce whether my Charge be juſt. How diſingenuous the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> was in that ſeeming profer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>number of Sacraments,</hi> is ſufficiently diſcovered in my <hi>Reply to his tenth paper,</hi> from <hi>page</hi> 236. to <hi>page</hi> 241. Now only let theſe few particulars be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. And 1. When did the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> make this profer? Only in his <hi>tenth</hi> or <hi>laſt paper,</hi> ime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diatly before his getting out of the nation. Why did he it not ſooner, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeeing we had been exchanging <hi>papers</hi> above a year before, and he had been frequently appealed to a diſcuſſe of particular Controverſies? Did he not in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>papers,</hi> poſitively decline to have the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> examined either by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity?</hi> By <hi>Scripture,</hi> becauſe as he affirmes, <hi>paper</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 37. <hi>The letter of Scripture is capable of divers, yea contrary ſenſes, and there is no Religion ſo falſe but pretends that the tenets of it are conforme to the letter of Scripture.</hi> By <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity</hi> alſo, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſayeth the <hi>Ieſuit, paper</hi> 5. <hi>page</hi> 61) <hi>This with as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be aſſumed by any Chriſtian falſe Religion.</hi> Yea, doth he not charge me as
<pb facs="tcp:101081:15"/>
               <hi>hatching a new Religion of my own,</hi> becauſe I appealed to the <hi>Fathers of the three firſt Centuries,</hi> in his 9. <hi>paper page</hi> 178. Now what ingenuity or courage is manifeſted by ſuch a ſeeming profer, at ſuch a time, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many <hi>declinaturs,</hi> ingenuous <hi>Romaniſts</hi> may judge. But <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Had there not been weighty <hi>Controverſies</hi> tabled before, <hi>viz.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Infallibility of Popes and Councils, the Perſpicuity and Perfection of the Scriptures, Tranſubſtantiation, Adoration of Images, Communion under one kinde, Papal indulgences, Apocrypha bookes, the Popes Supremacie over the whole Catholick Church, and his Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over Princes?</hi> Yea had it not been ſhewed, as the breviry of <hi>miſſives</hi> would permit, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth groſly erre in all theſe? Yet never did he offer to Reply to any of theſe. Let <hi>Romaniſts</hi> therefore againe judge, whether he who paſſes over in ſilence all <hi>Arguments,</hi> both from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> to prove the <hi>preſent Romiſh Religion erronious</hi> in all the foreſaid particulars, and only ſtarts a new <hi>Question</hi> about the <hi>number of Sacraments,</hi> doeth ſhew a through willingneſſe to have the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> tryed either by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity. Thirdly,</hi> If there he any <hi>Controverſie</hi> toſſed betwixt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m miſts</hi> and us, where a cavilling <hi>Sophister</hi> may wrap himſelf up under <hi>Logomachies,</hi> is not this it which the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> hath pitched upon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the <hi>number of Sacraments?</hi> Muſt it not be acknowledged on all hands, that as the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> is taken in a larger or ſtricter ſenſe, a man may affirme that ther be more or fewer <hi>Sacraments?</hi> But of this you may ſee more at length, in the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſwere</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuits tenth paper, page</hi> 238. and 239. Let it be then conſidered, how willing the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> was of a <hi>Scriptural tryal,</hi> who dates not adventure on the examination of other <hi>Controverſies,</hi> and only betaks himſelf to this, wherein the <hi>Adverſarie</hi> may ſhut himſelf up in a thicker of <hi>Logomachies?</hi> But <hi>fourthly,</hi> Doth the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> really profer to have that on <hi>Controverſie</hi> concerning the <hi>number of Sacraments,</hi> betwixt <hi>Papists</hi> and us decyded by <hi>Scripture?</hi> Or doth he bring <hi>Arguments</hi> from Scripture to prove a preciſe Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenary of proper Sacraments, neither more nor fewer, which is the Doctrine of the Preſent <hi>Romiſh Church?</hi> Nor at all. What then? Only that he might ſeeme to ſay ſomething, he deſires me to prove
<pb facs="tcp:101081:16"/>from <hi>Scripture</hi> that there be only two <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or that there be no more then two, which is, in very deed, to require me to prove the <hi>Negative,</hi> while he himſelf declynes to prove the <hi>Affirmative, viz.</hi> That there is not only more then two, but compleatly ſeven. Though the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> demand be irrational, I hope I have ſatisfied it, in its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. But what though I had ſuccumbed in proving that there were no more but <hi>two proper Sacraments?</hi> Yet the queſtion betwixt <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and us, concerning the <hi>number of Sacraments</hi> were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyded, except it be proven that there be <hi>preciſely ſeven,</hi> neither more nor fewer. If there be not a preciſe <hi>ſeptenary,</hi> one <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh faith</hi> falls to the ground. Conſequently, the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Queſtion concerning the <hi>number of Sacraments</hi> to a <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tryal,</hi> untill he offer to prove by <hi>Scripture</hi> a <hi>preciſe ſepetenary of proper Sacraments,</hi> which as yet he hath not done, nor I believe will adventure to doe. He will find need of the ſupplement of his <hi>unwriten traditions</hi> here: But neither I ſuppoſe will theſe ſerve his turne. But <hi>Fifthly,</hi> what are all theſe <hi>enſuing papers,</hi> but a demonſtration of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> tergiverſing humor? In his <hi>firſt paper,</hi> he propoſed <hi>foure postulata</hi> like ſo many <hi>Oracles.</hi> I diſcovered an egregious <hi>fallacy</hi> in one of them. But to this day he never once endeavoured to vindicat himſelf. He propoſed in that paper an informal <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> (but could never thereafter adventure on a ſecond,) which was retorted in better forme againſt the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> more wayes then one: but theſe <hi>Retortions</hi> to this houre remaine unexamined. I denyed the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of that long ſtudied <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> but he could never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to undertake the <hi>probation</hi> thereof. In that <hi>Aſſumption</hi> the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> had ſaid, that the PROTESTANT <hi>Religion had no grounds to prove its conformity with the letter of Scripture.</hi> To repell that bold allegeance, I appealed him to produce any ſolid ground of conformity with Scripture, which either the <hi>True Chriſtian Religion</hi> hath, or that the <hi>Popiſh Religion</hi> can pretend to, which the <hi>Religion of</hi> PROTESTANTS wants. But he could never be moved to produce any. Sometimes he hinted at the <hi>Infallibility of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of the Articles of Faith,</hi> but he durſt neither adventure to
<pb facs="tcp:101081:16"/>tell whom he meant by theſe <hi>Infallible Propounders,</hi> or to prove the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of <hi>Romiſh Propounders,</hi> or to anſwere <hi>Arguments</hi> againſt their <hi>Infallibility.</hi> At length, being outwearied with his tergiverſing, I produced <hi>poſitive Grounds,</hi> for proving the conformity of our <hi>Religion</hi> to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the diſconformity of theirs, <hi>viz. The Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity of the Scriptures in all things neceſſarie,</hi> and <hi>Conformitie with the faith of the Ancient Church in the first three Centuries.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he poſitively declyned both <hi>Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> in theſe <hi>first three Centuries,</hi> as a <hi>teſt</hi> to find out the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding that ſtill he ſhunned to come to particulars, I pirched u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that much controverted <hi>Scripture,</hi> which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> pretend to be as favourable to them as any, <hi>viz, Hoc eſt Corpus meum, This is my Body,</hi> and proved the ſenſe which PROTESTANTS give thereof to be True and Genuine, and the ſenſe which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> impoſe to be falſe and abſurd. And offered to doe the like concerning other controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Scriptures, ſuch as <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not. Matthew</hi> 16.18. <hi>Upon this Rocke I will build my Church.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The pillar and ground of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. This I did in the <hi>Anſwere</hi> to his <hi>ſeventh paper,</hi> from <hi>page</hi> 126. to <hi>page</hi> 130. But all theſe he waves as tedious <hi>Digreſſions</hi> in his <hi>eight paper, page</hi> 148. I reſolved alſo to try his behaviour more particularly, in reference to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and therefore in the <hi>Anſwere</hi> to the <hi>Ieſuits eight paper,</hi> from <hi>page</hi> 169. <hi>to page</hi> 173. I produced <hi>ſeven articles</hi> of the preſent <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> which I briefly ſhew to be repugnant to the faith of the <hi>Ancient Romiſh Church, viz.</hi> Their <hi>Adoration of Images,</hi> Their <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> Their <hi>Communion under one kinde,</hi> The <hi>Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> Their mantaining the <hi>Apocryphal bookes</hi> to be <hi>Canonical Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Papes uſurped Juriſdiction over Princes,</hi> and their <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences for eaſing Soules under the paines of Purgatory.</hi> But this is all the <hi>Anſwere</hi> which the tergiverſing <hi>Jeſuit</hi> makes to theſe particulars, in his paper 9. page 176. <hi>What makes it to our purpoſe, your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions about Images, about Tranſubſtantiation, about Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kinde, about the Popes ſupremacy, about Apocryphal bookes, about Indulgences, Purgatory,</hi> &amp;c. I gave likewiſe ſome account of
<pb facs="tcp:101081:17"/>their corrupting, the <hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>Practicals</hi> of Chriſtianity by their impious doctrine of <hi>Probables,</hi> in the anſwere to his <hi>eight paper, page</hi> 162. 163. &amp;c. But to this he anſwered <hi>Ne</hi>

Did ever, I pray an <hi>ill cauſe</hi> fall into the hands of a more unhappie <hi>Advocat?</hi> Whether now my charge againſt the <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> as on that declynes to have the truth of <hi>Religion</hi> tryed either by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity</hi> be juſt, let him who who ponders theſe particulars, and peruſeth all the <hi>Papers,</hi> judge. Had I tergiverſed as the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> hath done, had I been left at ſuch diſadvantages as he, would they not have made the World ring with it? What ever <hi>anſwere</hi> ſhall be returned to me, Our <hi>Popiſh Apostats</hi> will be ready to entertain it with <hi>Plaudire</hi>'s, as if the field were wone. But I hope they who are judicious will hereafter leſſe regard their clamours, having ſuch experience of their triumphing, when their <hi>Champion</hi> had behaved himſelf in ſuch a piteous faſhion.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are pleaſed to boaſt that how ſoon theſe <hi>papers</hi> come abroad they ſhall have an <hi>Anſwere</hi> tripping upon their heels.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T had been ſufficient for me, upon the firſt reading of your paper, inſtantlie to have returned this or ely anſwere, NIGO MINORIM, <hi>I deny your minor.</hi> For I found but a poor naked Syllogiſme, the aſſumption
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101081:21"/>whereof is ſplendidlie falſe, and ye have not ſo much as added the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a proofe to confirme it. Neither can ye be exempted from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyed to prove it, becauſe it is a Negative, as ſhall afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Yet for the clearing of truth, and alſo, (if it may pleaſe GOD) for your conviction, I have added theſe following animadverſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And firſt, Ye lay down foure previous <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> as ſo many oracles, which might extort an aſſent from any Reader. But you muſt give me leave to tell you, how ſpecious ſoever they ſeeme to you, they want not their own flawes. Take one inſtance from your <hi>third pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> wherein there is an egregious fallacie committed in your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that conditionall, wherein ye ſuppoſe all parties to agree. For it is one thing to know that the ſenſe given to ſuch a text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is, <hi>the true ſenſe intended by the holy Ghoſt when he dyted ſuch words;</hi> which is the condition at firſt mentioned by you, and it is a quite other thing, to know that he who gives the ſenſe, <hi>hath the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt to give that true ſenſe,</hi> which ye hold out as the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the former. This latter ſavors rankly of that erroneous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh tenet, concerning the neceſſitie of an <hi>infallible viſible judge</hi> of controverſies. Now, is it handſome, under pretence of explayning a propoſition wherein all agree, to foyſt in one of the maine points of difference, as if that alſo were agreed upon? could there be a greater cheat put upon a ſimple Reader?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, It had been of more uſe then all theſe your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, to have laid down the <hi>Theſis</hi> which ye were to oppugne; and to have explained the terms thereof. Since therefore ye have omitted it, it will be neceſſary for me to doe ſomething to it, leaſt we ſeeme to fight <hi>Andabatarum more,</hi> as Perſons blindfolded. The <hi>Theſis</hi> then which we defend and you oppugne, is this.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>The Protestants Religion is the True Religion.</head>
                  <p>Take theſe few hints of explication of the terms. By <hi>True Religion,</hi> We underſtand the true doctrine of ſalvation concerning God, and the right way of ſerving and worſhipping him. By the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> we mean, the Chriſtian Religion contained in the holy Scripturs.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101081:21"/>By <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> theſe Chriſtians who proteſt againſt, and doe reject <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh-Errors</hi> and additions to Scripture truths. So that <hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> is our Religion, and our <hi>Proteſtancie</hi> is not our Religion, but our rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Popiſh corruptions. If then ye conſider the importance of the <hi>Theſis</hi> which ye impugne, ye will find that ye undertake a hard work, nay, an Infidells cauſe. Namely, that the <hi>Chriſtian-Religion</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the holy Scriptures, and held by theſe who are called PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANTS, becauſe of their rejection of <hi>Popiſh-Errors,</hi> is not the true Religion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Becauſe ye ſo oft make mention of ſome peculiar <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> which the true Religion muſt have to prove it ſelf to be the true Religion, and which cannot be verified of a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which ye illuſtrat by the ſimilitude of an <hi>Honest-man</hi> and a <hi>Knave.</hi> I deſire, that theſe two things may be noted in reference to this; which may perhaps give ſome light to the whole matter. And firſt, theſe Grounds and Principles muſt be underſtood, <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> on the part of the object, not of the ſubject. That is to ſay, that the true Religion hath ſufficient Grounds in it ſelf, to manifeſt it ſelf to be the true Religion, if it meet with a well diſpoſed intellect. For, (to uſe your own ſimilitude,) an <hi>Honest-man</hi> may have Ground enough to ſhew a diſtinction betwixt him and a <hi>Knave,</hi> albeit a fool cannot diſcerne it. So the true Religion may have Ground enough to prove it ſelf true, (which the falſe religion hath not,) though an Infidell, or Heritick, <hi>whoſe fooliſh minde is darkened. Rom.</hi> 1.21. cannot take it up. Secondly, The prime peculiar difference of the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from a falſe, ſtands in its conformitie to the will of GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scriptures; and this conformitie, hath a ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſeck objective evidence in it ſelf, to any who have a well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed underſtanding, to collate and compare theſe two together, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the exact correſpondence betwixt the one and the other. This likewiſe may be illuſtrated by your own example of <hi>Honeſtie</hi> and <hi>Knaverie.</hi> An <hi>Honeſt</hi>-man being one whoſe actions are ſquared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, what ever a <hi>Knave</hi> may pretend, yet when both are compared to the Law, the <hi>honeſt-Mans</hi> converſation is found to be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101081:22"/>that which the Law enjoineth; not ſo the <hi>Knaves.</hi> So that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie which is the conformitie of his actions to the Law, hath an intrinſeck objective evidence, to demonſtrat it ſelf to any diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſon, who can compare the mans actions with the Law. So it is in the preſent caſe. Yet, beſides this intrinſeck objective evidence, which is in true Religion, I doe not deny, but there are many externall and acceſſorie Grounds which ſtronglie perſwade its credibilitie.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hade ye intended to ſatisfie the conſcience of any Perſone, you would have held forth theſe peculiar grounds and characters of a true Religion, which is conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of God; and ye would, at leaſt, have endeavoured to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that theſ did exactly quadrat with your <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and not at all with the Religion of PROTESTANTS. But as to this, there is nothing but deep ſilence in your paper. Before you make good your retreat from this Argument, as thus inverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelf, ye may perhaps find, that ye are taken in the ginne which ye deſigned for others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 2 But Secondly, I wold try you with another <hi>Reterſion,</hi> thus. If the true Religion have grounds and principles to prove its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to the true ſenſe of the letter of the Word, then no article of Faith and Religion can be founded upon an <hi>unwritten Tradition.</hi> But the firſt is true <hi>Ergo</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Minor</hi> is clear from the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> of your Syllogiſme. The conſequence of my <hi>Major</hi> is no leſſe clear. For it is impoſſible that an article founded meerly upon an <hi>unwritten Tradition,</hi> ſhould prove its conformitie with the letter of the written word of God, elſe it ſhould be written and not written. Nor can ye handſomely reſile, by ſaying you did thus only argue, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> againſt PROTESTANTS. For this your Syllogiſme, you deduce from your foure premiſed propoſitions, which, ye ſuppoſe, ought to be agreed to, by all Parties. Now what thankes you are to expect for this manner of arguing, from your late Pamphleters, who doe ſo highly magnifie your unwritten Traditions, ye your ſelf may judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 3. But Thirdly, leaving Retorſions, I Anſwer directly denying
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101081:23"/>the Aſſumption, <hi>viz.</hi> that the PROTESTANT Religion hath no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ground or principle to prove that it is a true Religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD. Nay ſurely, it hath that <hi>intrinſeck objective evidence,</hi> in its conformitie with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, to demonſtrate it to be the true Religion, of which I was ſpeaking a little before; which neither <hi>Poperie,</hi> nor any other falſe Religion either hath, or can have. But now, it lyes on you as the <hi>Opponent</hi> to prove your Aſſumption. It ſeemed ſtrange to me, that this Propoſition whereon the whole ſtreſſe of the Controverſie didly, was ſo nakedlie propoſed by you without any proofe. Onely it would appear, becauſe it is a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi> you would lay over upon me to prove the contrarie. Are ye ſo ſoon wearie of the <hi>Opponents</hi> office, who were ſo eager to have it? Find you the burthen of impugning the <hi>Religion of Proteſtants</hi> ſo heavie, that ſo ſoone ye ſhrink under it? Are there no Negative Propoſitions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Schools? Doth not Philoſophie teach us more <hi>Moods</hi> and <hi>Formes</hi> of Negative Syllogiſmes then of affirmatives? Shall there be no way to oppugne an affirmative poſition but by turning the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to an Opponent? Yea, let me put you in minde, that though your <hi>aſſumption</hi> and <hi>concluſion</hi> be expreſſed Negativly, yet, upon the matter, we doe rather mantaine the <hi>Negative,</hi> and you the <hi>affirmative.</hi> Which I thus make out. If any conſider our Religion and yours; it will be found that in moſt of our <hi>Poſitives,</hi> ye and we are agreed. As that there is a GOD, three Perſons, that Chriſt is both GOD and man, &amp;c. But the difference is moſtly in our <hi>Negatives.</hi> As for inſtance, Ye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the neceſſitie of a viſible infallible judge of controverſies, we deny. Ye affirme the neceſſitie of ſubjection to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as head of the Catholick-Church, we deny: Ye affirme that there is a prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per propitiatory ſacrifice in the Maſſe, we deny: Ye affirme that the Apocrypha books are Canonick Scriptures, we deny: Ye affirme that Saincts are to be invocated; that Croſſes, Images, and your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall Hoſty are to be adored; we deny: Ye affirme a Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, we deny, &amp;c. In all theſe and ſuch as theſe we mantaine the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and ye the Affirmative, yea, and theſe are your Superaddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto Scripture truths. And conſequently, when it is demanded,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101081:23"/>whether that which we, or ye mantaine in theſe particulars, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the ſenſe of the Scriptures? The meaning is, whether doth the Scripture hold theſe things out, or not? Ye affirme, and we deny. Therefore, according to the ſaying, that, <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manti incumbit probatio;</hi> It lyes upon you to find out the exact meaſures of the true Religion, and the peculiar Grounds, which doe evidence its conformitie to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD, and alſo, to demonſtrate that theſe Grounds cannot agree to the Religion of PROTESTANTS. <hi>Bellarmin, Gretſer, Valentia,</hi> and others of their fellowes who have travelled long in this work, have been able to effectuat nothing, by all their vaſt Volumes. And have ye the confidence to doe the buſſineſſe by this one naked Syllogiſme?</p>
                  <p>But that I may ſhut up theſe lines, remember, ye cannot now call upon me to ſhew a peculiar ground or evidence, which the Religion of PROTESTANTS hath, to prove it ſelf to be the True Religion, and that it is conforme to the True ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For Religion is not one individuall truth, but a complex of many truths, which cannot all be proven at once, or with one breath, though there be none of them, but through the mercie of GOD, we are able to demonſtrate againſt any Adverſarie. But now it lyes upon you, as the <hi>Opponent,</hi> to prove your <hi>Aſſumption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inſtance therefore, if ye can, one <hi>Ground</hi> Neceſſarlie requiſit for evidenceing and proving the True Religion, and its conformitie to the True ſenſe of the Scriptures, which is wanting in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of PROTESTANTS; which, I hope, I may confidently ſay, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, nor any of your fraternitie, ſhall ever be able to doe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To this Argument you anſwere firſt carping it that is not in forme, as having two Premiſſes <hi>Negatives,</hi> but in this you are farr miſtaken; for the Negation in one of the Premiſſes is not taken <hi>Neganter</hi> but <hi>Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanter,</hi> and doth not affect or light upon the <hi>Copula,</hi> but is a part of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101081:25"/>the ſubject of the Propoſition. Next you anſwere, as you ſay, directly admitting the Major and denying the <hi>Subſumption,</hi> to wit, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion hath no ſpeciall ground or principle to prove that it is conforme to the True ſenſe of the letter of the Word of GOD, and ſo denying that it hath no speciall ground or principle, you conſequently muſt affirme that it hath ſome speciall ground or principle, whereby it can prove it ſelf to be deſtinguiſhed from a falſe Religion, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the True ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD. Now lay all theſe things together, first, that under your own hand writ, ye have undertaken to mantain the Proteſtant Religion to be a True Religion. Next that you grant a Religion cannot be True, except it have ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ground or principle whereby it can prove it ſelf to be Ture, or conforme to the True ſence of the letter of the word of God. Thirdly, that you deny that the Proteſtant Religion hath not thir speciall grounds and principles whereby ſhe may prove herſelf to be True and conforme to the True ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD. Now let any be judge whether to weind your ſelf out of this labyrinth, and without manifeſtly deſerting of your cauſe, ye be not oblidged to produce theſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar grounds or principles whereby you ſay that Proteſtant Religion is furniſhed to prove it ſelf to be True, and conforme to the True ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD. Which likewiſe may be extorted by this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either the Proteſtant Religion is furniſhed with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grounds or principles to prove it ſelf to be True and conforme to the True ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD, or it hath no ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: if it have no ſufficient principles, then confeſs ingenuouſly it is a groundles Religion; if it have them, then let them be produced and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, And why doe you reſerve &amp; keep them up, ſince the producing of them is neceſſarie to mantaine and defend the truth of the Proteſtant Religion? are they perhaps inviſible, or are you aſhamed to bring them to light? only remember that the grounds or principles that you produce to this effect, to prove your Religion to be True, must be ſpeciall and have this propriety, that they ſo prove the Proteſtant Religion to be True, or conforme to the True ſenſe of the letter of the word of God, that they cannot be affirmed to prove a falſe Religion (and which you your ſelf holdeth for a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101081:25"/>to be a True Religion, or conforme to the True ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD. As the ground or principle which is produced to prove Honeſty, or one to be an honest man, must have this propriety that it cannot ſerve to prove a knave to be an honest-man.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in your paper you inſinuat two ſuperficial and fleeing ſhifts and evaſions which doth nothing help you. The first is, that the Proteſtant Religion hath, <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> intrinſeck grounds and principles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is conſtitute a True Religion, though it hath not, <hi>ex parte ſubjecti.</hi> But this onely is to bring new obſcure termes, which put in good SCOTS, ſignify onely the ſame, which hath been ſaid hitherto; to wit, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion hath intrinſecall and objective truths and conformitie with the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GO'D, but is deſtitute of all ſpeciall grounds or principles whereby it can prove it ſelf to have ſuch intrinſecall and objective truth and conformity. But I pray you, what falſe Religion is there, that may not with as good reaſon apply the ſame termes to themſelves, and ſay that their Religion is true, <hi>ex parte ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti,</hi> and hath intrinſecall and objective evidence, truth and conformity with Scripture, though they cannot ſhew this, <hi>ex parte ſubjecti.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they have as great Reaſon as you to ſay that their Religion, and the truth of it may be made evident, if it encounter with an underſtanding well diſpoſed, though it cannot be made evident to fools. So, you are pleaſed civilly to call all thoſe who have their underſtanding of ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that they cannot ſee the truth of your Religion.</p>
               <p>The other ſhife and evaſion is, that Religion is not one individual truth but a complex of many truths, which cannot be proven at once, or in one breath. But what makes this to your purpoſe? ſince that before you can prove any one of thoſe particular truths, to be conforme to the true ſenſe of the text of ſuch a Scripture; you must first produce ſome speciall ground or principle to prove that your Clergie-men <hi>in Actu primo</hi> hath ſuch aſſiſtance or hability as is prerequired in men that ſhould give out to People the true ſenſe of particular texts of Scriptures: or elſe how can men be induced to beleeve that the ſenſe which you give is the true ſenſe? ſince every falſe Religion might pretend with as great reaſon as you doe, that they give the true ſenſe, though plaine contrane to the ſenſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101081:26"/>that you give.</p>
               <p>In the end of your paper you deſire me to ſubſcrive, and to put my name to the anſwere that I make, as you have put to your name to yours, but this your demand doth not ſeem rationall, ſince your condition and mine are not alike, for you are at home, and as a Cock on your own midden, and there muſt lurke ſome other thing under this demand, ſince it can make nothing to your cauſe, who proponeth the reaſons againſt, if they be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and to the purpoſe.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101081:27"/>and ſo your pretence of liberating your ſelf from being tyed to prove it, doth wholly evaniſh.</p>
               <p>There be diverſe other things in your paper, deſerving ſevere caſtigation, but they are truely ſo Iudibrious, that it is irkſome to me once to mention them. Nay hardly ſhall any thing materiall be found in the whole paper, beſide the repetitions of what ye had ſaid in your firſt. Yet leſt the wrapping up of all theſe in generall, ſhould give you occaſion to ſay, that my complaint were groundles, I ſhall therefore branch forth two or three of the particulars.</p>
               <p>And firſt, Ye ſeeme to ſtrengthen your Syllogiſme, with a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> which yet upon the matter is nothing but <hi>Recocta crambe,</hi> the ſame thing in a new dreſſe. And thereupon you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, not without petulancie, as if you hade nothing to doe, but to triumph, ſaying, <hi>Hath the Religion of PROTESTANTS no principles whereby to prove it ſelf? Are they inviſible? or, are you aſhamed to produce them?</hi> Soft, I beſeech you. Is the Sun invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, becauſe the blind Mole doth not ſee it? Did I not tell you, that the Religion of PROTESTANTS, hade peculiar grounds and principles to prove it ſelf to be a True Religion? Did I not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declare, wherein this chief Ground and Principle conſiſted? Namely, in its conformity to the Will of God, revealed in the holy Scriptures. Which neither Popery nor any falſe Religion hath or can have. Were you ſo dull as not to take up this? or, if you did, why did you not either acknowledge it, or at leaſt, goe about to diſprove it? I find you indeed a little after, objecting thus. <hi>What falſe Religion is there that may not ſay with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, that they have the like conformity with the Scriptures?</hi> But did I not pre-occupie this cavil in my firſt paper, and by your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Honeſty and Knavery, illuſtrate the whole matter? know therefore againe, that it is not pretended, but reall conformitie with the Scriptures, which demonſtrats a True Religion. A Knave may pretend (but not with good reaſon,) conformity with the Law, which he hath not. And the only way to diſcover
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101081:27"/>him, is to compare his actions with the Law; whereby the diſſonancie thereof will appear. A man may be ſo abſurd, (though contrary to reaſon,) as to affirme a crooked lyne to be ſtraight: But when his lyne comes to be applyed to the rule, the obliquity thereof is clearly diſcovered. Juſt ſo, <hi>Popery</hi> and other falſe Religions, may prerend, (albeit with as little good reaſon,) a conformitie to the word of GOD. But learned Divines, by applying the rules of Scriptures to them, have demonſtrated their obliquity and diſſonancy, as with a Sun beam. Hath not this been the way, how our Lord Chriſt, his Apoſtles, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eient Fathers, and the faithfull witneſſes of Truth, confuted Hereſies and falſe Religions in all ages?</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, In your next ſection you prevaticat, yet more groſly. For whereas, I had ſaid that the True Religion hath ſufficient grounds, <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> to prove it ſelf, to be a True Religion. Ye offer thus, to make Scors of my words. <hi>That the PROTESTANT Religion, hath intrinſecall and objective truths, and conformity to the ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD, but that it is deſtitute of all ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grounds, to prove it ſelf to have ſuch objective truths and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Scriptures.</hi> I beleeve, rarely hath ſuch contradictory <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe</hi> been heard. You might aſwell, if I had aſſerted Snow to be white, have concluded, that I mantained it to be black. Did I not make plaine Scots of my aſſertion in my own paper, explaining it thus. <hi>That is to ſay, That the True Religion hath ſufficient grounds in it ſelf, to manifest it ſelf to be the True Religion, if it meet with a well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed intellect.</hi> Or if ye would have it yet clearer, take it thus. The True Religion hath ſuch grounds to manifeſt its truth, That if it be not taken up and aſſented to, it is not through any defect in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but through the defect and indiſpoſition of the ſubject, which it meets with. You doe acknowledge, that I affirme the PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANT Religion to have <hi>Objective evidence.</hi> If it have objective evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, how can it want grounds to manifeſt it ſelf to be the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? what elſe, I pray you, can be meant by <hi>Objective evidence,</hi> but grounds, <hi>Exparte objecti,</hi> to manifeſt it ſelf? Let this be a Caution to you, that you doe not henceforth ſubſtitute your <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> as an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101081:28"/>explication of my aſſertions.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. In your penult ſection, ye involve your ſelf in a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable contradiction, ſaying <hi>That before any particular truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion be proven to be conforme to the true ſinſe of Scripture. it muſt firſt be proved that the Clergie hath ſuch habilities and aſſiſtance,</hi> in actu primo, <hi>as is requiſit for giving out the trueſenſe of Scripture.</hi> If you mean, <hi>infallible aſſiſtance,</hi> ye not only take for granted, what ye know, all PROTESTANTS doe deny; but alſo, ye declare that no ſenſe of Scripture can be taken off your hand, or ſuch Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiquers as you. Seeing, according to your <hi>Romiſh</hi> principles, none below the <hi>Pope,</hi> or generall <hi>Councill,</hi> are the ſubjects of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infallibilitie. Yes, not only are your own men divided in this, whether this infallible aſſiſtance, be entailed to the <hi>Pope or Councill,</hi> but alſo, ſome of your greateſt Rabbies, have conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that both <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councill</hi> may erre. And if ſo, who then according to your Arguing, ſhould give the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But leaving this, to let you ſee how your own words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle you, I ſhall deſire you to conſider this <hi>Enthymeme.</hi> Before any particular truth of Religion, be proven to be conforme to the true ſenſe of the Scriptures, this muſt firſt be proven, that the Clergie hath ſuch requiſite habilities, and aſſiſtance <hi>In Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primo,</hi> for giving the true ſenſe, <hi>Ergo,</hi> this truth, concerning the Clergies habilities and aſſiſtance muſt be proven before it be proven, which implyes a manifeſt contradiction. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is your aſſertion. The Sequel is clear. Becauſe, that the Clergie ſhould have ſuch aſſiſtance, (according to you) is one truth of Religion. If therefore it muſt be proven before every truth, it muſt be proven before it ſelf. Is not this, not only to contradict the truth, but your own ſelf. Who would not pitie a Perſon ſmitten with ſuch a <hi>Vertigo?</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Conveniet nulli qui ſecum diſſidet ipſe.</q>
               <p>Go not henceforth to cavill, that it is either through diffidence or tergiverſation, that I decline to prove the contradictorie of your <hi>Aſſumption.</hi> The Grounds on which I have done it, are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101081:28"/>theſe. Firſt, becauſe, that I reſolve to keep with you exactly, the rules of diſputing. And therefore, ſeeing you have taken upon you, the office of an <hi>Opponent;</hi> you muſt eit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you cannot impugne. Secondly, becauſe, to prove the PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS Religion, to be a True Religion, is to prove the ſeverall Articles of our Religion, to be conforme to the Scriptures, which as I ſaid, cannot be done with one breath. But if you deſiderat to ſee it done, I ſhall remit you to <hi>Chamieri Panſtratia Catholica;</hi> not to mention the workes of other Champions for the Truth. In the mean while, remember, I have appealed you (and yet againe doe,) to inſtance any <hi>One Ground</hi> neceſſarly requiſit to prove the True Religion, which is wanting in the Religion of PROTESTANTS.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of all, you offend, that I ſhould have deſired you to ſigne your papers. And your language concerning this, ſavours of a <hi>Dunghill.</hi> But I ſhall ingenuouſly tell you, why I did deſire it, That I might know, with whome I deal. For this hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as one of your <hi>Romaniſts</hi> practiſes, when ye have been worſted in debates, then to alleadge, it was no Scholler, that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained ſuch a debate, but ſome obſcure Perſon. Againe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is required of you, that you would ſigne your papers, as you would have them regarded.</p>
               <p>I once intended with this paper, by way of retaliation, to have ſent you ſome demonſtrations that <hi>Popery</hi> cannot be the True Religion. But as yet I have ſpared, becauſe, I confeſſe, it is l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR reply is ſtuffed with words, wherewith ye undervalue all things that are brought against you; calling them none-ſenſe, raw and indigeſted, that you have a faint disputant, that the matter is <hi>Recocta crambe,</hi> &amp;c. But doe you not know that ſuch tenor of words are called <hi>Sagittae parvulorum.</hi> Since every one who hath a

               <p>Laying then purpoſely aſide all things that are out of the way, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone to you againe this point, that the Proteſtant Religion cannot be a True Religion, nor the Religion to the which God hath annexed the promiſe of eternall life, and conſequently, whoſoever aimes at eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, after this life, or intends to ſave his ſoule, is obliged in conſcience to quite it, and to ſearch for the True Religion, preſcinding or abſtracting for now, where this True Religion is to be found, and inſiſting for the preſent in this only point; that the PROTESTANT Religion cannot be it: and aſſure your ſelf that this point will be a <hi>Crambe cocta et re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocta,</hi> and alwiſe ſet before you, till by ſufficient heat you diſgest, and make good ſubſtance of it. This point we proved by this one Syllogiſme, which againe is repeated to you.</p>

                     <item>That Religion cannot be a True Religion, which hath no peculiar ground nor principle to prove that it is a True Religion, or conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD.</item>
                     <item>But the Proteſtant Religion hath no peculiar ground or principle, to prove it ſelf to be a True Religion, or a Religion conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD.</item>

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:101081:30"/>
               <p>Here you deny the <hi>Subſumption,</hi> that is you deny that the Proteſtant Religion hath no peculiar ground or principle to prove it ſelf conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD, and conſequently, you affirmed that it hath peculiar grounds or principles, whereby it can prove it ſelf to be a Religion, grounded upon the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD, and being preſſed to produce your grounds, to prove the truth of your Religion, in stead of ſolide grounds, you produce theſe two ſleeing ſhifts and evaſions.</p>
               <p>The first is, That the Proteſtant Religion hath intrinſecall grounds <hi>Ex parte objecti,</hi> though it have not alwiſe <hi>Ex parte ſubjecti,</hi> that is, if they doe not alwiſe prove, the defect is not in the Religion, or in the grounds conſidered in themſelves, but in the indiſpoſition of the ſubject to the which they are applyed. But it was told you that it was a meer ſhift, and that your obſcure termes being reſolved in good Scots, ſignifies onely, that your Religion hath objective and intrinſecall truth, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD, but ſo, that it is deſtuute of all speciall ground or principle, whereby it can prove it ſelf to be grounded upon the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD. And that your anſwere can have no other ſenſe but this, is proven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all thir foure propoſitions are <hi>Synonima,</hi> to wit, A Religion, to be a True Religion, A Religion to be conforme to the will of GOD revealed in Scripture, A Religion to have objective and intrinſecall truth and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, A Religion that is able to convince, if it meet with a well dispoſed intellect or capacity. Theſe foure propoſitions being all Synonims, and ſignifying the ſame thing, and ſo all equally in controverſie, you cannot prove one by another, but you must prove them be ſome extrinſecall and diſtinct <hi>Medium,</hi> otherwiſe you muſt grant that your anſwere is a meer ſhift, and which in good Scots ſignifyes only this. That your Religion is true in it ſelf, but hath no peculiar ground whereby it can be proven to be true, and ſo we muſt beleeve it to be true, only becauſe you ſay that it is. And with this, I ſet againe before you this <hi>Recocted Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> Either the Proteſtant Religion hath ſpeciall grounds to prove that it is a True Religion, that it is a Religion conforme to the will of GOD revealed in Scripture, that it is a Religion that hath objective or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101081:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>intrinſecall truth and evidence, that it is a Religion able to convince any intellect that is well diſpoſed, or elſe it hath no speciall ground or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whereby all thir can be verified of it. If it have speciall grounds, let them be produced and examined: if it have none, let an ingenuous confeſſion have place, that it is groundleſs and deſtitute of all principles, whereby it can prove theſe foure Synonime propoſitions to agree to it. Which is confirmed: becauſe any Religion even that which is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged be themſelves to be falſe, may affirme with as good reaſon, and pretend that all theſe foure fore-named Synonime propoſitions, may be verified of their Religion. To wit, that their Religion is a True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that their Religion is conforme to the will of GOD revealed in Scripture, that their Religion is true, <hi>Ex parte objecti,</hi> and hath obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and intrinſecall grounds, that their Religion is evident and true, if it meet with an intellect well dispoſed. All the anſwere and disparity you give, is, that they are fools and ye wiſe men, that they are blind, and ſo no wonder that they cannot ſee the clear beams of the truth of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion But may not they apply all this to you, with as good reaſons as you doe to them?</p>
               <p>The other ſhift that in ſtead of a ſolide ground you brought was this, that you were not obliged to give a particular ground or principle, to prove in generall your Religion to be true, becauſe Religion ſay you is not an individuall truth, but a complex of many truths whereof one must be proven after another. But this anſwere is a meer ſhift, whereby you would decline the onely and maine difficultie, by bringing in a whole body of controverſies: which likewiſe can no wayes help you. Becauſe before you can prove any one of theſe particular truths, to be conforme to the true ſenſe of ſuch a text of Scripture, you must first by ſome speciall ground or principle prove that your Clergie. Men hath <hi>In Actu Primo,</hi> ſuch aſſiſtance and habilitie, as is prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in men who ſhould give the true ſenſe of particular texts of Scripture. ſince everie falſe Religion may pretend that they give the true ſenſe though contrarie to the ſenſe that you give.</p>
               <p>To this you reply, that it is a contradiction to ſay: that before other particular proofs be proved to be conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101081:31"/>of the word of God, it muſt firſt be proven, that their Clergie hath ſuch abilitie and aſſiſtance <hi>in actu primo,</hi> as is requiſite to give the true ſenſe of Scripture. Becauſe ſay you, this ſame that the Clergie ſhould have <hi>in actu primo,</hi> ſuch aſſiſtance is one particular truth, and ſo, if it ſhould be proved before every particular truth, it ſhould be proved before it ſelf. And it ſeems, you have great compleaſance and are fallen in love with this anſwere, as with a prime and unſwearable ſubtilitie, backing it both with proſe and meeter, and likewiſe, advertiſeing me to conſider it. But I likewiſe advertiſe you to conſider, how that in this you fight only with your own ſhadow. For firſt, may not a propoſition be in it ſelf one and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and yet have an object univerſall, in the which, though it be contained, yet the thing affirmed of that object, doe not agree to it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye would by this, prove that <hi>David</hi> contradicted himſelf, when he pronounced this propoſition, <hi>All men are liars;</hi> for if all men be liars, and <hi>David</hi> be a man, then he was a liar, in ſaying all men are liars. Next, what makes it to the purpoſe, whether the neceſſitie of particular aſſiſtance <hi>in actu primo,</hi> in Clergy men, to give the true ſenſe in other particular truths; what imports I ſay, that this is ſo of an generall object, that it is in it ſelf one particular truth diſtinct from the reſt, it being ſufficient, that it be ſuch a particular truh of whom other truths depends, and of the which, the people muſt firſt be convinced, before they can be perſwaded, that other particular points proponed to them, are revealed in ſuch texts of Scripture. Wherefore take this <hi>Recocted dilemma</hi> againe, either the Proteſtant Religion hath speciall grounds or principles, whereby mens underſtanding can be convinced, that their Clergie is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified <hi>In actu primo,</hi> with ſuch aſſiſtance and habilitie as is requiſite to perſwade the people, that they give the true ſerſe of the letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or they have no ſuch grounds or principles. If they have, then let them be produced, and examined. If they have no ſuch grounds and principles, they cannot exact of people to beleeve their gloſſe, as the word of GOD ſince without this particular and interior aſſiſtance, they can onely gueſſe at the true ſenſe of the text of Scripture.</p>
               <p>As to that you deſire againe, that I ſigne my anſwere with my name, and that you require this, becauſe you would know with whome you deal,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101081:31"/>and becauſe it hath been obſerved, to be one of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> practiſes, when they have the worſt in debates, to alleadge, it was no Scholer that ſuſtained ſuch debate, but ſome obſcure perſon. But good Sir, in what Regiſter did you find ſuch a practique, or whether they may not with greater reaſon be turned over upon your ſelves? and who will not ſmile, to hear you compare your ſelf, and your Divines, with Catholick Authors? Since it is known, that the moſt part of the doctrine that you vent, either in Pulpits or Schools, is copied out of them. The thing then deſired of you, is, that you anſwere to the reaſons proponed, not careing by whom they be proponed.</p>

That ye are not aſhamed, to offer to me a Paper, bearing the inſcription of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;</hi> when ye ſeeme as affrayed to touch the chief points in my Paper, as you would be to handle a Serpent. Did I not charge you with grievous <hi>Omiſſions</hi> in my laſt? Why doe you not clear your ſelf of that <hi>Fallacie,</hi> in the third propoſition of your firſt Paper? Why doe you not anſwere, to the <hi>Retorſions</hi> of your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, againſt your ſelf? Why doe you not either prove your <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> or elſe refell the arguments, by which I ſhew that ye were tyed to prove it? Did I not demonſtrate the pertinencie of all theſe particulars, and withall, conjured you to ſpeake to them, as you would not incurre the heavieſt characters of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie? What conſtruction after all this, can your deep ſilence bear, but that you are not able to acquit your ſelf in theſe points? Hath there been one article of controverſie in any of your Papers, which I have not examined? whether therefore you, or I, be guilty of tergiverſation, or diffidence, the unbyaſſed Reader may judge.</p>
               <p>I am ſo wearied with your Tautologies, that I ſhould not have deignied this paper with an anſwere; but that I know, the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous impudence of many of your Party, to be ſuch, that if no anſwere had been returned, (how inſignificant ſoever your paper be,) they would have inſulted, and ſung <hi>Victoria.</hi> But let me ask you ſeriouſly, doth the frequent repetition of this poor naked <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> either help the forme, or ſtrengthen the matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101081:32"/>of, both of which have been juſtly queſtioned? Are battologies ſo ſavourie, and delicious to your Popiſh palat? will the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of your <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, extort an aſſent, from theſe who have the uſe of their reaſon? How oft will ye conſtraine me to tell you, that I deny your <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> and conſequently, the ſecond branch of your ragged <hi>Dilemma,</hi> which is wholy coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therewith, and that I have long deſiderated the probation of both? But ſeeing ye have ſome fancie for <hi>Dilemma's,</hi> I will repone this one to you. Either you can prove the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of your Syllogiſme, or not. If you can, give I pray you a <hi>specimen</hi> of your <hi>Acumen,</hi> and tergiverſe no longer. If ye cannot, then profeſſe ingenuouſly, (as the truth is,) that ye have undertaken a work which ye cannot performe. And it is no wonder that here you be at a <hi>Non-plus.</hi> For, if the Chriſtian Religion revealed in Scripture, hath grounds to prove it ſelf to be the True Religion, (which none but a down right Infidell can deny,) then ſurely, the Religion of PROTESTANTS, wanteth not grounds to prove it ſelf. For the Religion of PROTESTANTS, is the Chriſtian Religion, revealed in the holy Scriptures, as I told you in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the terms in my firſt Paper. And conſequently, what ever ſolid grounds were brought either by theſe Ancient Apologiſts, <hi>Iuſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Athenagoras, Arnobius, &amp;c.</hi> Or are held out in the moderne tractats of <hi>Morney, Grotius, Amyrald,</hi> yea in your own <hi>Vives,</hi> to prove the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, theſe alſo prove the truth of the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> of PROTESTANTS. Nay, doe not you Romaniſts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the moſt of all our Poſitives? So that the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which remains, is, Whether you Papiſts have any evidence for your ſuperadditions. And is it not your concernment to ſhew this? But when I think upon your Tautologizing way, it calls to my minde the cuſtome of children, who, when their memorie failes them, in ſaying their leſſon, leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to ſay nothing, they will needs ingeminate the laſt word. Away then for ſhame with theſe childiſh, unmanly, and inſipid repetitions.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101081:33"/>
               <p>You blot much paper needleſly, with foure <hi>Synonima propoſitions.</hi> But I might advertiſe you, firſt, that your diſcourſe concerning them, is wide from the purpoſe. For it ſuppoſeth, that I am now proving the Religion of PROTESTANTS to be the True Religion, which is not at preſent my work. But ſeeing ye have undertaken to impugne it, my buſſines is, to cleat it from your cavills. Secondly, I doubt if ye can reconcile, what ye have ſaid of the Equipollencie, of theſe foure Propoſitions, with your <hi>Tridentine Faith.</hi> For if it be the ſame thing, for a Religion to be a True Religion, and to be conforme to the Scriptures, then it cannot be true, which your <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath defined, that <hi>Unwritten Traditions,</hi> are to be received <hi>Pari pietatis affectu,</hi> with equall devotion, as the <hi>written Word of GOD.</hi> For, if this <hi>Tridentin Canon</hi> be true, the truth of Religion, cannot ſtand adequatly in its conformity to the Scriptures, but partly in its confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Scriptures, and partly, in its conformity with unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten traditions, and conſequently, your fore-mentioned propoſitions, cannot be adequatly <hi>Synomma's.</hi> You may bethink your ſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye, or the <hi>Councill</hi> be in the Error? But thirdly, granting theſe propoſitions to be <hi>Synonima's,</hi> that is, to have an <hi>Objective identitie:</hi> I pray, by what Logick will ye prove, that one of them, cannot be brought to prove the other? Is it not lawfull to argue, <hi>á Definitione, ad Definitum,</hi> betwixt which, there is an objective identity? Doe not Logicians acknowledge an identity, betwixt objective <hi>Premiſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Concluſion?</hi> And therefore, though a True Religion be a Religion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme to the Scripturs, yet, there is no abſurditie in proving the truth of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by its co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity to the Scripturs. Even as, to uſe your old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, from which ye are fallen off, (as ſeems) becauſe, it made ſo much againſt you. An action to be honeſt, and conforme to the Law are <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonima's,</hi> and yet, the beſt way of proving it to be honeſt, is, to prove its conformity to the Law. By all this it appears that your plain Scots, (which ye are not aſhamed againe to repeat) is plaine <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> as I demonſtrated in my laſt. For the truth of Religion conſiſting in its conformity with the Scripture, may be demonſtrated by holding out its conformity with the Scripture. An objective evidence of a Religion being nothing elſe, but a ground whereby the truth of Religion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101081:33"/>may be demonſtrated, it is unconceivable, how a Religion can have objective evidence, and yet want a ground, whereby to manifeſt it ſelf to be a True Religion. If here you but underſtood your own ſelf, I hope there would be no more controverſie, as to this, betwixt us. So that the matter is not obſcured by my terms, (as you ſay,) but by your contradictory <hi>Non-ſenſe.</hi> As to your frivolous oft repeated cavill, that a falſe Religion may pretend the like conformity and objective evidence, it was confuted ſo fully in my laſt, that I ſhall remit you to what was then ſaid. Though <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Hypochondriack,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may mantaine Snow to be black, Shall that make others who have their eyes in their head, and the uſe of their Reaſon turne Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, and queſtion, whether it be white or black.</p>
               <p>Towards the cloſe, ye paſſe by many things, (as your couſtome is,) which I hade ſaid concerning the aſſiſtance of your Clergie men, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give the true ſenſe of Scripture. And ye only labour to extricat your ſelf from that <hi>Contradiction,</hi> wherein I ſhew you to be involved, but all in vaine. Nay ye involve your ſelf the more, by affirming, <hi>That a propoſition, may have an univerſall obiect, whereof it ſelf is a part, and yet, that ſomething may be affirmed of that univerſall object, which cannot be affirmed of that part of the object.</hi> A rare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forſooth! implying a manifeſt repugnancie. But I am loath to digreſſe, to a Philoſophick debate with you. Can any thing (I pray you,) be affirmed of every man, which cannot be affirmed of you and me? As for that propoſition of <hi>Davids, All men are liars,</hi> which you bring to illuſtrate your paradoxall notion. How could you make uſe of it in your argueing with me, untill firſt you proved your infallibility? For, (if you may be beleeved,) I can take no ſenſe of it from you, untill you firſt prove your ſelf infallible; which, (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,) you pretend not to. But, it is your ill luck, to be ſtill involved in contradictions. Yet, to ſpeake more particularly of this example, and not to take up time in enumerating the ſeverall acceptions, of this <hi>Syncategorematick</hi> particle, <hi>All,</hi> it may be evident that <hi>David</hi> did not take it <hi>Univerſally,</hi> of all men, in reference to all their ſayings, elſe he had not only convicted himſelf of a lie; but alſo, charged all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101081:34"/>the penne men of holy Scriptures, as liars, in all that they ſaid. Which, I beleeve, no rationall Perſon will affirme. It muſt therefore be reſtricted to one of two. Either, to theſe who had ſaid that DAVID ſhould be King; and if thus, it was indeed an over-reaching, and falſe aſſertion in DAVID. For among theſe the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> was one. And no wonder that DAVID did over-reach in this, for he acknowledges, he ſpake it, <hi>in Feſtinatione,</hi> in his haſte. Or ſecondly, (to which I rather encline,) it muſt be underſtood thus, every meer man, of his own nature, is prone to lying, and fallible, as your <hi>Esthius</hi> and <hi>A Lapide,</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4. And many others doe expound it. And ſo it holds univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and can be affirmed of every one, who is a meer man; and yet <hi>David</hi> not be guilty of actuall lying, in ſpeaking ſo. Nay this ſentence of <hi>Davids,</hi> reaches a deep ſtroke, at the pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of your Clergie; except, ye can prove, that they have a ſpeciall gift, of infallible aſſiſtance, which I beleeve you will doe when you prove your aſſumption: Namly, <hi>Ad Graecas Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Never.</hi> You are then ſo farr, from having any ſubſidie, from this ſaying of DAVID, that while you goe about to expede your ſelf, you doe involve your ſelf the faſter. But I leave you in this thicket, untill I conſider your other evaſion. For,
<q>Mus miſer est uno, qui tantum clauditur antro.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You therefore except this truth, <hi>Concerning the aſſiſtance of the Clergie,</hi> from being in the condition of other particular truths: As if the knowledge of this, were to be preſuppoſed, before we can know the conformity of any other particular truth to the Scriptures. But this ſhift yeelds you no more ſuccour then the former. Nay, it leaves you likewiſe in a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> which I thus demonſtrat. A Religion, and the ſeverall points thereof to be true, and to be conforme to the true ſenſe of Scripture, are <hi>Synonima's,</hi> according to you. Therefore, no point of Religion can be known to be true, untill it be known, to be conforme to the true ſenſe of Scripture. But, that the Clergie ſhould have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101081:34"/>ſuch aſſiſtance, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give the true ſenſe of Scripture, is one point of Religion, as you affirme. Therefore, it cannot be known to be true, untill its conformity with the true ſenſe of Scripture be known. And yet upon the other hand, you ſay, that, before the true ſenſe of any Scripture be known, we muſt firſt know, that the Clergie hath ſuch aſſiſtance to give the true ſenſe of it, <hi>Ergo,</hi> that the Clergie hath ſuch aſſiſtance, muſt be known, before the true ſenſe can be known. And conſequently, the aſſiſtance of the Clergie, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> muſt be known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſenſe of Scripture, and not before the ſenſe of Scripture. Now, what need have you of <hi>Ariadnes</hi> clue, to wind your ſelf out of this labyrinth?</p>
               <p>By this, it is eaſie to conſider, what we are to think of your laſt <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either (ſay you,) <hi>The PROTESTANT Religion hath ſpeciall grounds, to prove that the Clergie hath this aſſiſtance,</hi> In actu primo, <hi>to give the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, or it hath not, if it hath, let them be produced, and examined: if it hath not, then the People have no ground to beleeve their Teachers.</hi> Who ſeeth not, how eaſily this may be retorted upon your ſelves? For, either the <hi>Romiſh-Religion,</hi> hath ſpeciall grounds, to prove that their Clergie hath this aſſiſtance, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture; or, it hath not. If it hath, let theſe grounds be produced, and I doubt not, but upon examination, they ſhall be found light. If it have none, then the poor deluded People, have no ground to beleeve their Romiſh Doctos. Nay, it were eaſie, (if I did not fear too great prolixitie,) to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that this falls much more heavylie on the <hi>Romiſh-Religion,</hi> then it can doe on us. For, how (I pray you,) can your <hi>Romists</hi> know, that they have any Clergie at all? Seeing, the being of their Clergie depends upon a condition, whereof they can have no infallible certainty. Namely, the intention of the Ordainer, as is defined both in the <hi>Councill of Florence, and Trent.</hi> And if they cannot know who are their Clergie Men, farr leſſe can they know that they have this aſſiſtance, ſo much talked of. Againe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101081:35"/>If the knowledge of their Clergies aſſiſtance, be ſuch a prerequiſit, then, it ought to be defined, to which of the Clergie this aſſiſtance is entayled. Whether to all, or onely to ſome, and who theſe ſome are, whether the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>General Councill?</hi> But as to this ye are not agreed among your ſelves. Nay, as I hinted in my laſt, ſome of your chief Doctors mantaine, both <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Councill</hi> may ert. Define then (if you can,) who theſe are, that are to give the ſenſe of Scripture, with this pretended aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Therefore, to anſwere directly to your <hi>Dilemma:</hi> If you ſpeake of infallible aſſiſtance, I abſolutly deny, that the knowledge of ſuch infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libity, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> in the Clergie, is a neceſſarie prerequiſit, before the true ſenſe of Scripture may be known. And now againe, the probation of this will ly upon you. Which (I beleeve,) ye ſhall find as difficult, as the probation of your <hi>Aſſumption.</hi> Can I not give an aſſent, to a Juriſt explaining ſome of the <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> of <hi>Justinian,</hi> or receive from him ſatisfactory reſolution of a Law-caſe, unleſſe firſt I know him infallible? Can I not aſſent to him who explains or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrats a propoſition of <hi>Euclyd,</hi> unleſſe firſt I be ſatisfyed as to his infallibility <hi>In actu primo?</hi> I wiſh your Proſelytes would deal with you according to your principle, and beleeve nothing you ſay, till you prove your infallibility. But to remove the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of this your miſtake. Know that our Peoples faith is not built on our Authority. We arrogat nor <hi>Dominion over their faith, we are but helpers of their joy.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. But ſeeing you have pitched upon the knowledge of the infallible aſſiſtance of the Clergie, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> for giving the true tenſe of Scripture, as a neceſſarie prerequiſit, before the true ſenſe of Scripture can be known; which the PROTESTANTS deny. I therefore appeal you, to prove this to be a neceſſarie prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit, if you can.</p>
               <p>Ye are not a little commoved, that our Divines ſhould be compared to yours. It is long indeed, ſince the pride of the <hi>Romiſh Clergie,</hi> made an eminent Perſon ſay, <hi>Odi feſtum iſtius Eccleſiae,</hi> but I may ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vainity, to the praiſe of GOD, there have been eminent Lights in the Reformed Churches; ſuch as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Juel, Whitaker,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101081:35"/>Morton, Uſher,</hi> &amp;c. Who lake onely ſome years to make them be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled among the <hi>Fathers.</hi> Neither indeed doe I deſire them to be otherwayes compared with your men, then as one would compare <hi>Auſtine, Jerom,</hi> or <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> with the Hereticks of their time. Yet, would I not put all the Doctors of your Church in one claſſe. Some we know, have been of a more moderate principle, then the <hi>Grandees</hi> of your faction, for which cauſe many of their writtings have ſuffered by your <hi>Judex Expurgatorius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How are you not aſhamed, to ſay, that the moſt we teach in Schools or Pulpits, is copied out of your Authors? Do we (I pray you,) reach <hi>Popery</hi> either in Schools or Pulpit? Doe we cite your Authors, but to confute them? Or, doe we make further uſe of them, except in common truths, wherein we and ye agree? as we make uſe of Heathen Authors; and as <hi>Virgil</hi> made uſe of <hi>Ennius,</hi> to extract <hi>Aurum ex ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core Ennii;</hi> or, as the skilled Surgeon can make uſe of <hi>Vipers</hi> fleſh, to compound a ſoveraigne Triacle.

Since, as I am informed, you did firſt dyt it to your Scholers, who out of zeal to the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Maſter, did uſe all diligence to diſperſe many copies of it: and although it be not authentick, and ſubſcrived with your hand, with the ſolemuities uſed in your former paper, yet, for the ordinarie straine of digreſſions, not making to the purpoſe, I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it for yours. And it is pleaſant, that you ſay that you mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, that I paſſe over in ſilence, and does not anſwere. But how can you marvell at this, ſince I have alwayes proteſted to you, and protest to you againe, that I would cloſſe miſken, and take no notice of any thing that is out of the way, and which does not concern the deciſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101081:36"/>controverſie, to wit; Whether the Proteſtant Religion can be ſhown to be a True Religion, by any ground or principle, which may not ſerve with as great Reaſon, to prove any falſe Religion to be a True Religion. And ſo ſoone as you (who hath bragingly undertaken, to prove the truth of your Religion,) ſhall produce any ſuch ground, whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that you put your ſelf at leaſt in the way, either to give ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory anſwere, or at leaſt, to confeſſe ingenuouſly, that you have no ſuch ground for your Religion; I oblige my ſelf, and ſhall finde you Surtie, that I ſhall anſwere at length to all your Digreſſions, to all your Retorſions, and likewiſe, ſhall disput with you at great leaſure, about the rules of Logick, and ſhew how groſlie you are mistaken, in confounding <hi>Objective negations,</hi> with <hi>formall negations,</hi> as if a formall affirmation, might not fall upon objective negations united be an objective affirming <hi>Copula.</hi> As for your injurious and undervaluing words, both in Greek, and Latine, wherewith your paper is ſtuffed, calling all things brought against you, Tantologies, Battologies, Inſipid and Childiſh things, and Non-ſenſe, &amp;c. I told you before, that any man that hath a tongue, may heap up and utter injurious words, even against GOD himſelf. And this way of proceeding, would be thought by the judicious, to be a clear teſtimony of a deſerted cauſe, and that, ſince by ſufficient reaſon you cannot propt the tottering truth of your Religion, at leaſt by Digreſſions, Injurious words, and other practiſes, you will ſhoulder and hold up your reputation before ſimple people, who adjudges the Victorie to him who rails moſt. As if the means to try a True Religion from a falſe, were not of ſuch high concernment it ſelf alone, as did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to confine both your thoughts and penne within the gyre of it. So that without wrouging the weightines of the matter, ye cannot decline to ſquable about other things, before it be fully ended.</p>
               <p>Laying then aſide as before, all other things as out of the rod; this is laid againe before you, that the Proteſtant Religion, cannot be the true Religion, nor the Religion to which GOD hath tyed the promiſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, and conſequently, whoſoever armes at eternall happineſſe after this life, or intends to ſave his Soul, is obliged in conſcience to quit it, and betake himſelf to a diligent ſearch for the True Religion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinding
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101081:37"/>for now, where it is to be found, and inſiſting for the preſent is this, that the Proteſtant Religion cannot be it. This point is proven at before by this Syllogiſme.</p>

Only be pleaſed to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that ſince you deny the ſubſumption, and ſo puts your ſelf in obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to produce grounds for the proofe of your Religion, that the grounds you produce, muſt have this propertie, that they cannot ſerve with as great reaſon to prove a falſe Religion, to be a True Religion, As the grounds which ſerves to prove one to be an honeſt man, muſt have this propertie, that they cannot ſerve to prove a knave, to be an honeſt man. Neither doe you ſatisfie in ſaying, that Honeſtie conſiſts in a conformity of actions with the Law, as Knaverie in a deformity of actions to the Law: this I ſay does not help you, becauſe this is onely to explicat the terms, and to draw the lineaments not filling up the fields and vacuities. For the preſent controverſie is not wherein conſiſts objective Honeſtie, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Knaverie; nor wherein conſiſts objective truth of Religion, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101081:37"/>falſhood of Religion: but ſuppoining the one to conſiſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, or difformity of actions to the Law, and the other to conſist in a conformity, or difformity with the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD: it remains to ſhew by ſome ſpeciall ground, wherefore of one man is verified this objective Honeſtie, and not of the other? and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of one Religion is affirmed this obiective truth, and not of the other? To this you anſwere, that this is eaſily known, be applying and comparing onely the actions of both with the Law, and the tenets of both, with the word of GOD, as the obliquity and crookedneſſe of a rule, is preſently known by applying it to a ſtraight and even rule, and with this popular diſcourſe, you think to have cleared, and exhausted all the difficulty. But good Sir, give me leave to diſcover the ſhallowneſſe, and ſuperficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this anſwere. You ſay objective Honeſtie is proven to agree to ſuch a man, becauſe his actions are conforme to the Law. But I ask you, what if the letter of the Law, with the which you compare the actions, be capable of divers, yea, contrarie ſenſes, and the knave pretend that the actions of his Knaverie, are conforme to the Law, taking the letter of the Law in the ſenſe that he give it? In this caſe can one be proven to be an Honeſt man, unleſſe there be produced ſome speciall ground, to ſhow that his actions are conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the Law, and which cannot favour the Knave, nor his actions? Likewiſe, ſince the letter of Scripture is capable of divers, yea, contrarie ſenſes, and there is no Religion ſo falſe, but pretends that the tenets of it, are conforme to the letter of Scripture, taken up in the ſenſe that they give it: there reſts no remedie to prove a Religion to be true, or to be diſtinct from a falſe, but by producing ſome speciall ground, which is not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to a falſe Religion. And hereby the way appears how eaſily ſimple people are gulled, and at how eaſie a rate their favour and ſuffrages are obtained, be a diſcourſe, ſmoothly, and plauſibly proponed, and attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered to their capacity, though in the mean time it be deſt-tute-of all truth and ſoliditie.</p>
               <p>Out of this you may ſee, that ſince you have undertaken to prove the truth of your Religion, and grants that the truth of a Religion, cannot ſubſist without ſome ſpeciall ground, denying the ſubſumption, that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101081:38"/>affirms the want of all grounds, there reſults out of all theſe, a neceſſity and obligation upon your part, to produce ſome ſpeciall grounds for the truth of your Religion, whereby you may make appear, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective truth, or the objective grounds of a true Religion, doth agree to your Religion, and which cannot ſerve, to prove that the objective truth, or objective grounds of a true Religion, agreeth to a falſe Religion. Neither doth it exempt you from ſatisfying this obligation, the pretext that you are the Defender, and I the Impugner, becauſe, to me, as the Impugner, belongs onely to preſſe you, either to grant that you have no grounds, or to produce them to be impugned.</p>
               <p>Now let us come to the ſhifts and evaſions which ye have produced in place of ſolid grounds. The firſt was, that your Religion hath objective truths, or objective grounds of evidence, though they be not alwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincent, by reaſon of the indispoſition of the ſubject to whome they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned. But, it hath been told you, that all thir are <hi>Synonims,</hi> A Religion to be a true Religion, A Religion to have objective grounds of truth and evidence, A Religion to be conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD, A Religion that is convincent if it encounter with an intellect well dispoſed. And ſo thir being all <hi>Synonims,</hi> and all equally in controverſie, one cannot be ground to prove one another, but they muſt all be proven by ſome other thing. And this was told you, and is now repeated againe. Neither doth it help you, the anſwere that you inſinuat in this paper, that, although they be all <hi>Synonims,</hi> yet one of them may ſerve to prove another, as it is lawfull to argue <hi>A Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitione ad Definitum,</hi> though there be an objective identitie betwixt them, as likewiſe, betwixt objective premiſſes and the concluſion. But in this, as before, you diſcover your ſhallowneſſe, in touching onely the ſcreofe, not going deeper. Becauſe this way of arguing doth not hold, when both the <hi>Definition</hi> and <hi>Definitum</hi> are in controverſie, whether they doe agree in ſuch a thing, for then they muſt be proven by ſome other ground. Moreover, may not all this with as great reaſon be aſſumed of a falſe Religion, and which you your ſelf acknowledge for a falſe Religion and why may they not ſay that their Religion hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective grounds of truth and evidence, and prove this be this other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101081:38"/>
                  <hi>Synonime,</hi> that their Religion is conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD? Now all the anſwere that you alwayes give, is, that thoſe that ſees not the truth of your Religion, have an intellect ill dispoſed and tempered are Fools, Blinded, and now you adde that they are to be esteemed for Hypochondriack perſons. But all this is as eaſily turned over upon your ſelf, ſince men that denyes and profeſſes that they can ſee no truth in your Religion, are in all other things as diſcurſive and as ſharp ſighted as your ſelf.</p>
               <p>The other ſhift that you bring, when you are preſſed to produce ſome speciall ground, whereby may be made manifeſt the truth of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is, That Relgion is not an individuall truth, but a complex of many truths, which cannot be proven altogether, but ſucceſſively, one after another. But, who ſees not this to be a meer ſhift, in place of a difficulty, to ſubstitute a whole body of particular controverſies, which though they may now be begun, yet requires years to bring them to an end? And doth not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teah us, that we ſhould alwiſe begin <hi>Ab univerſalio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> before we deſcend to particulars, least doing otherwiſe, we be forced to repeat often the ſame things? Likewiſe remember, that the ſame ſhift with as great reaſon, may be alleaged by any falſe Religion, to decline the neceſſity, that they have to give grounds to prove the truth of their Religion.</p>
               <p>As for that, in which you enlarge your ſelf to ſhew an <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> in my diſcourſe, whereby I told you, that before you can induce the people to beleeve, that you propone the true ſenſe of particular texts of Scripture, you muſt firſt produce ſolid grounds, that you are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſuch aſſiſtance, and ſuch directions, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give out this true ſenſe. In this I told you before, that you are fighting with your own ſhadow: and putting up a faigned adverſary to your ſelf that afterward you may have a faigned pleaſure in puting of him down. For what contradiction can it be, to ſay, that the actuall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or, <hi>Actus ſecundus,</hi> doth neceſſarly ſuppone, <hi>Actum primum,</hi> and if, <hi>In actu ſecundo,</hi> you give the true ſenſe of the letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then neceſſarly you muſt be furniſhed <hi>In actu primo,</hi> with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ability to give this true ſenſe? Or how can any exerce ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101081:39"/>of Seeing, Hearing, Speakeing, <hi>In actu ſecundo,</hi> except he be ſupported to have <hi>In actu primo,</hi> ſufficient ability to doe thir operations? And you muſt have great dominion over your intellect, if you can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf, that this diſcourſe involves a contradiction. Now I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you to cloath this ragged <hi>Dilemma,</hi> as you call it. Either you can produce ſome speciall grounds, whereby can be made manifest, that your Clergie men are qualified <hi>In actu primo,</hi> with ſufficient ability and aſſiſtance, to give the true ſenſe of particular texts of Scripture, and let thir grounds be produced, and ſhown, that they cannot be aſſumed with as great reaſon, to prove that the Clergie of a falſe Religion, hath this ability <hi>In actu primo,</hi> or elſe, you are deſtitute of speciall grounds, and then it is impoſſible that your Clergie can give the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe, it is impoſſible to doe any thing <hi>In actu ſecundo,</hi> without a speciall ability <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to doe it. So that all the ability that your Clergie is furniſhed with, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> is onely, to gueſſe at the true ſenſe of Scripture, and wherefore, ſhould people pay you Stipend for gueſſing, ſince they are endued with ſufficient ability themſelves, and without you, to gueſſe at the true ſenſe of Scripture.</p>
               <p>In this your laſt Paper, you adde a third ſhift, to wit, that all the grounds, whereby <hi>Tertullian</hi> and other Fathers, proved the truth of Chriſtian Religion againſt <hi>Paganes,</hi> proves likewiſe the truth of your <hi>PROTESTANT Religion.</hi> But who will not laugh at this anſwere, as if there were no Christian Religion but your <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Religion? And what Chriſtian Religion is ſo falſe, which may not with as great reaſone aſſume this ſhift of yours? As to that, whereby you remitt me to the grounds, which <hi>Morney, Grotins,</hi> and others of your own Authors brings, I pray you, ſince they are your own, take all the help you can of them, and either be diſtilling or ſqueezing all their writs. Expreſſe me one ſolid ground to prove the truth of your Religion, which may not with as great reaſon, be applied to prove a falſe Religion to be a true Religion.</p>

But beleeve me, I ſhould not have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed you for your delay, if at length, you had ſupplied the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of your former Papers, and done the work of an <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> neatly, and throughly, as ye were required. <hi>Sat cuò, ſi ſat benè.</hi> But, you muſt give me leave, to give you a free Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of this Paper. I finde it to be nothing but a Rapſodie of Railings, Repetitions, Tergiverſations, yea, and ſhamefull flinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from your own principles. So that, if I miſtake not, it had been more for your credit, utterly to have kept ſilence. For, <hi>Stultus eſt labor Ineptiarum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time it appears, that it is loſt labour, to preſſe you any further, to make a <hi>Reply</hi> to the principall points of my former Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. For now, you proteſt you will not doe it, and you cloak your ſhamefull tergiverſation, with this pellucid excuſe, that theſe things in my Papers were out of the way. That is, (if you may be beleeved,) impertinent. But who, beſide you, will ſay, that it was impertinent for me, to diſcover a <hi>fallacious Sophiſtication,</hi> in the ground of all your diſcourſe? What ingenuous perſon, would not have judged himſelf concerned, to clear himſelf of ſuch an imputation? Yet, though this hath been now foure times charged on you, ye think it not pertinent to vindicat your ſelf. Who, beſides you, but will acknowledge, that it was perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for me to demonſtrate, that by your own diſcourſe, you had enſnared your ſelf in <hi>Contradictions,</hi> and had cut the ſinews of your <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Tridentine</hi> faith? What a poor Advocat then are you for the Romiſh cauſe, and an unworthy Stipendiarie to your Maſter the <hi>Pope,</hi> who have no more to ſay, but, that it is not pertinent for you now to ſpeake to theſe things? But what need I wonder at this? Seeing you judge it impertinent to prove the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of your own ſyllogiſme, which I had not onely requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to doe, but alſo, condeſcended to demonſtrate by many

But till then how can you expect courteſie at my hands? Might not a man of your years, have learned ſo much diſcretion, as not to preſcribe methods of anſwereing, to his Adverſarie? Vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates for victorie and not for truth, doe not become grave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Yet, I purpoſe never to decline to exchange a Paper with you, or any Romaniſt, either upon a Philoſophicall, or Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall ſubject, when I ſee it for edification, or the Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. This trifling encounter with you, hath made the eſteeme of your Romiſh breeding to fall exceedingly with me. For though you have been of ſuch fame among theſe of your Cabal, that I promiſed to my ſelf learned and accurat diſcourſes from you, yet I muſt profeſſe, that the moſt of the lines which I have received from you, have been like the ludibrious pratlings of a <hi>Quaker.</hi>

               <p>You take it ill, that I accuſe you, of your Tautologies, and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies. Is it a cryme to call <hi>Scapham Scapham,</hi> or to call black, black? Had I not juſt cauſe ſo to doe, when now the fourth time you have repeated one <hi>Paralogiſme,</hi> yea, and glorie in your recocted colworts, as if they were delicious food? Would it not tempt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of another, to have to doe with one, who will needs ſtill repeat the ſame note? <hi>Apage coccyſmum.</hi> You call upon me, <hi>To cloath your naked, and informall Syllogiſme, with an Anſwere.</hi> If you look back on the Papers, which ye have received from me, you will find, that I have returned three <hi>Anſweres</hi> unto it in my firſt Paper, though, as then I told you, it was unworthy of any further reply, then, NEGO MINOREM, <hi>That I denied the Minor.</hi> Is it not rather your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, <hi>To cloath your Syllogiſme,</hi> with a probation of the denyed Aſſumption? All that was incumbent to me, was to publiſh the <hi>Nakedneſſe</hi> of it, which I hope in ſome meaſure I have done. You ſay, that they who have a tongue, or penne, may throw the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches upon me. <hi>I</hi> have indeed ſufficient experience of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings. For it is ordinary with you, to upbraid me with ſhallowneſſe, and ſuperficialneſſe, &amp;c. Yet theſe ſhallow diſcourſes have ſo (as ſeems,) affrighted you, that ye have not adventured to plumbe them. But, <hi>I</hi> rather never put penne to paper, before you, or any other, had juſt ground to accuſe me, of ſuch Childiſh repetitions. If you hold on in this way, the like fate may befall you, which did that <hi>Rudolphus,</hi> who for his trifling, was to his reproach, ſirnamed, <hi>Nugax.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have deſerted the cauſe, which I have undertaken, as you are pleaſed to reproach me, let your ſelf, or any of my moſt prejudicat adverſaries, after they have peruſed all theſe Papers, judge?</p>
               <p>You have ſtudied now at length an evaſion, but a miſerable one, to elude the example whereby I did illuſtrate in my foregoing Papers, that the truth of Religion may be proven, by holding out its conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Scriptures, even as the honeſtie of a mans actions, may be demonſtrated by holding forth the conformity thereof with the Law. <hi>But what</hi> (ſay you,) <hi>if the letter of the Law, be capable of divers, yea, and contrarie ſenſes,</hi> and then making application to Religion, you
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101081:41"/>affirme, <hi>That the letter of the Scripture, is capable of divers, yea, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſes, and thereupon, you would inferr, that the truth of Religion cannot be known by its conformity with the Scripture.</hi> But you are ſo unhappie in all your arguings, that they are both falſe on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and returne with more violence on your own head, then upon your adverſarie. And firſt, may it not with more reaſon be retorted on you, that the Canons of your <hi>Councills,</hi> the <hi>Bulls, Breves,</hi> and <hi>Decretalls</hi> of your <hi>Popes,</hi> and what elſe of that nature you would make uſe of, to verifie the truth of your Religion, are capable of diverſe and oppoſite ſenſes? Need I put you in minde of the eager debates of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> about the ſenſe of, <hi>Poſſe diſſentire ſi velit;</hi> in the <hi>Fourth canon</hi> of the <hi>ſixth ſeſſion of the Councill of Trent?</hi> Or, ſhall I remit you to ſee further digladiations of your Doctors, about the ſenſe of other Canons of the ſaid Councill in <hi>Vaſquez, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ſecundae disput:</hi> 203. and <hi>cap.</hi> 9? When you looſe this knot, in behalf of your Romiſh principles, you will eaſe your Adverſary of the paines, of diſcovering the vanity of your arguing. But I ſhall not wait for your help, and therefore, I plainly Anſwere by this diſtinction. If you mean that the Law, which is the meaſure of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt actions, is capable of divers, and contrarie genuine ſenſes, it is a manifeſt falſhood. For the Law cannot at once command two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, more then a man can at once, blow hot and cold breath out of his mouth; elſe, two contrarie propoſitions ſhould at once be true, which Logicians tells you, cannot be. But if you mean, that the Law may have divers, yea, and contrarie impoſed ſenſes, <hi>Sive ex inſcitia, ſive ex nequitia,</hi> whether through the ignorance, or perverſneſſe of cavilling impoſers, or, one genuine ſenſe, and others impoſed. It is granted, that this may be. But, theſe miſpriſions of cavillers, will not impede the clearing of the reall honeſtie of a good action, by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the genuine ſenſe of the Law. No more then the cavilling of a Sophiſter, pretending a crooked line to be ſtraight, will impede the diſcerning of a ſtraight line, from a crooked, by the application of both to the rule. Which was another example formerly made uſe of by me, of which alſo, in this your laſt paper you make mention, but the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101081:42"/>evidence thereof, ſeems ſo to have dazled your eyes, that you have not been able to finde out a Sophiſme, to elude it. This ſame diſtincton ſerves for the other branch of your diſcourſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Scriptures, For, if you mean, that the Scriptures have divers or diſparat, yea, and contrarie genuine ſenſes, intended by the holy Ghoſt: you ſpeake both falſly, and impiouſly, as if the Spirit of GOD did equivocat in Scriptures, and Scriptures were like to <hi>Apollo's</hi> dubious Oracles. But, if you mean onely, that divers and diſparat, yea, and contrarie ſenſes, may be impoſed on Scripture, through the ignorance or cavilling humor of men; it is granted. But this hinders not, but that, the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, may be demonſtrated by its conformity with the one genuine ſenſe of Scripture. Eſpecially, ſeeing, though there be depths in the Scriptures of GOD, yet they are clear in all things neceſſarie to ſalvation.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101081:42"/>to Salvation, then the Religion of PROTESTANTS, hath a clear ground to prove it ſelf to be a true Religion.</p>
               <p>But the firſt is true, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sequell of the Major is ſo clear, that your Romaniſts have no other evaſion, but to accuſe the Scriptures, ſometimes of obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, ſometimes of ambiguity, as being capable of divers, yea, of contrarie ſenſes. And in this, you imitate the old Hereticks, as appears, by that luculent teſtimonie of <hi>Irenaus, lib:</hi> 3. <hi>cap:</hi> 2. <hi>Cum ex Scripturis arguuntur in accuſationem convertuntur ipſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Scripturarum, quaſi variè ſint dicta, &amp; non poſſit ex bis inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niri veritas, ab iis qui neſciunt traditionem.</hi> The aſſumption is proved at length by PROTESTANTS, in the controverſies <hi>De Perfectione &amp; Perſpicuitate Scriptura.</hi> When you have tryed all the art of Ieſuitical Sophiſtrie, to diſprove theſe popular diſcourſes (as in the height of your Spirit, you are pleaſed to terme them,) I hope you ſhall find them both ſolid and impregnable.</p>
               <p>This may ſilence your clamour, that I ſhould produce a <hi>ground,</hi> by which the truth of the PROTESTANT Religion may be proved, for you ſuppoſe, that you are tyed to no more, but to preſſe me to produce the grounds of the PROTESTANT Religion, that you may impugne them. But, to ſilence this your vocife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you may remember, firſt, that I have demonſtrated that you are tyed to doe more. Had you indeed undertaken, to prove the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> that there is no true Religion at all, in this caſe, you might have demanded of me, a ground to prove a True Religion. But when you affirme, that, there is a True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which hath peculiar grounds, which can be verified of none elſe, you were tyed, to have produced theſe grounds, and to have demonſtrated, that they could not agree to the Religion of PROTESTANTS. Eſpeciallie, I having ſolemnlie appealed you to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101081:43"/>inſtance one ground, requiſit to prove the true Chriſtian Religion, whith is wanting in the Religion of PROTESTANTS. Secondly, You had not onely in the generall affirmed, that the True Religion had grounds to prove it ſelf, but you had particularly condeſcended upon one, namely, the knowledge of the aſſiſtance (as ſeems infallible,) of the Clergie, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give the true ſenſe of Scripture, before the true ſenſe thereof can be known. Whereupon in my laſt, I told you, this was expreſſly denyed by us PROTESTANTS, and therefore, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed you, if you could, to prove it. But you have been ſo farr from doing it, that you have ſhamefully flinched from it, as ſhall a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear. But thirdly, I have <hi>Ex ſuperabundanti,</hi> though not tyed thereto, by rules of diſputing, given you a <hi>Ground</hi> of the truth of the Religion of PROTESTANTS, namely, <hi>The Perſpicuity of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> (but not excluding the uſe of means,) in all things neceſſary to Salvation, which you might have collected, from that <hi>Intrinſeck ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective evidence,</hi> of which I ſpoke from the beginning. Onely remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that you call not upon me to prove this, though it were eaſie to doe it, and hath been done, times without number, by PROTESTANTS, in their debates againſt your Romaniſts. But now, we are to keep the rules of diſputing, and you have acknowledged, that it is your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, <hi>As the Impugner, when a ground is produced, to impugne it.</hi> And therefore, you muſt either doe your worke, or elſe become ſo ingenuous, as to confeſſe, that you are not able to impugne the truth of God. In the mean time, trouble me not with the cavils of your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, which have been often already refured by our Divines, elſe, I will remit you to the Authors, who have examined theſe Sophiſms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But, if you have any new thing, worthie of conſideration, you may propoſe it. I wiſh you were moved by ſuch principles, as he who ſaid, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>We can doe nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</hi> Yet doe you as you will, <hi>Fortis est veritas &amp; praevalebit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I had ſhewed you in my laſt, that your whole diſcourſe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your foure <hi>Synonime</hi> propoſitions, was both <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, wide from the purpoſe, and likewiſe inconſiſtent with your Tridentine faith. Yet, ſo rare a diſputant are you, that you make no returne to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101081:43"/>theſe things, what can I conclude, but, <hi>Qui tacet conſentire videtur.</hi> The reaſons which I brought, have ſo farr prevailed with you, as to make you explicitly grant, that of two propoſitions, <hi>Objectivly Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims,</hi> the one may be brought to prove the other, except when both are equally in controverſie. But this can be of no uſe for you, in the preſent caſe, untill you diſprove the <hi>Perſpicuity</hi> of the Scriptures, in theſe things which are neceſſarie to Salvation, which, I beleeve, you will finde beyond your reach. This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> alſo, takes off the cavill of Heretiks, pretending a conformity with Scripture, for theſe Hereticall vapours, cannot ſtand before the radiant beams of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-light.</p>
               <p>You diſcover both your Humour, and Ignorance, in alleaging, that it was a <hi>Shift</hi> in me, to ſay, <hi>That Religion being a complex of many truths, it could not be proven at once.</hi> Suppoſe a man had an hundred pieces to be tryed, whether they be upright Gold or not. Can (I beſeech you,) this be done, but by bringing every one of them to the Touch-ſtone? Suppoſe there were an hundred lines to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, whether they be ſtraight or crooked. Can this be done, but by applying each of them to the Rule? Even ſo, there being a multitude of points of Religion to be tryed, whether they be agreeable to Scripture or not. How can this be done, but by comparing each of them with the Scripture?</p>
               <p>I have admired nothing more, ſince my encounter with you, then your flinching toward the end of your <hi>Fourth Paper,</hi> from your own Principle. <hi>Viz. That the knowledge, of the aſſiſtaence of the Clergie In actu primo, is a neceſſarie prerequiſite, before the true ſenſe of any Scripture can be known,</hi> from which I had concluded you, to be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in an <hi>Inextricable contradiction.</hi> I had beſides reflected upon a <hi>Paradoxall,</hi> yea, and implicatorie notion of yours, <hi>That ſomething might be affirmed, of an univerſall object, diſtributively taken, which cannot be affirmed of every particular, under that univerſall.</hi> I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſcovered your Childiſh, and inconſiſtent diſcourſe, concerning that word of <hi>David, All men are liars.</hi> I ſhew further that your laſt <hi>Dilemma,</hi> concerning the Clergies aſſiſtance, did fall ſo heavily on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101081:44"/>your own head, that your <hi>Romists</hi> could have no infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, that they had any Clergie at all; let be, that they had this pretended aſſiſtance. Yet to theſe things, and many more, which here were tedious to me to repeat, you make no more particular Reply, then if they had never been objected to you. It your ſilence, the ſtrongeſt confutation of your Adverſary? All I find you ſaying is, <hi>What contradiction can it be to ſay, that the actual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Actus ſecundus, doth neceſſarly ſuppone Actum primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But, <hi>Quid hoe ad Rhombum?</hi> Was this the queſtion betwixt you &amp; me, whether the <hi>Actus ſecundus</hi> did preſuppoſe <hi>Actum primum?</hi> From which, no more can be concluded, but, that they who give the true ſenſe of ſcripture, when they give it, have aſſiſtance, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give it: which no <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or rationall man ever denyed. Yet, if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your Ieſuits principles, the <hi>Actus ſecundus,</hi> or actuall operation, doth not neceſſarlie preſuppoſe ſuch an infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> as here you ſeeme to plead for. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, <hi>Omnia quae tenent ſe, ex parte actus primi,</hi> in free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, may conſiſt, <hi>Cum actu, vel, actu contrario, vel actus nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi> But to leave this, the queſtion betwixt you and me, was, as appears by your former Papers, <hi>Whether the knowledge of the Clergies aſſiſtance, in actu primo, be a neceſſarie prerequiſite, before we can know the ſenſe of Scripture, given by them, to be true?</hi> Which is vaſtlie different from what you now aſſert. Who ſeeth not the difference betwixt this propoſition, <hi>He that gives the true ſenſe of Scripture, when he gives it, hath aſſiſtance in actu primo, to give it?</hi> And that other, <hi>Before I can know the ſenſe, given by ſuch an one to be true, I muſt antecedently know, that he hath aſſistance in actu primo, to give it?</hi> It is true, one cannot exerciſe the operations of Seeing, and Hearing, (which are your own examples,) unleſſe he have a ſufficient abilitie, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to exerciſe theſe operations. But he may exerciſe them, although he doth not know, and actually reflect upon the facultie which he hath, <hi>In actu primo.</hi> A beaſt both Sees, and Hears. ſo doeth an Infant, who yet, cannot reflect upon the <hi>Actus primus,</hi> of theſe operations, I can hardly ſay,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101081:44"/>whether in this prevarication, you have diſcovered more craftie falſhood, (you muſt excuſe this plainneſſe,) follie, or impudencie. Onely henceforth, I commend to you, that rule of <hi>Ruffin, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>hiſtoriae Eccleſiaſticae cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Dolis apud ignorantes locus est, ſcientibus vero dolum intendere, non aliud est quam riſum movere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards, you bring your old <hi>Dilemma</hi> upon the Stage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but in a more ludibrious dreſſe then before. <hi>Either ſay you, we can produce ſome ſpeciall grounds, whereby may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that our Clergie men are qualified, in actu primo, with ſufficient ability, to give the true ſenſe of particular texts of Scripture, and then let them be produced, or we are deſtitute of them, and then it is impoſſible, that our Clergie men can give the true ſenſe of Scripture, Becauſe, it is impoſſible to doe any thing, in actu ſecunde, without a speciall hability, in actu primo, to doe it. And ſo they can onely gueſſe at it.</hi> Who doth not ſee, how this judicious <hi>Dilemma,</hi> ſuch as it is, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyl upon your own head, <hi>Mutatis mutandis?</hi> But I did can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſe it ſo fully in my laſt, both by retortion, and direct anſwere, which you have not as yet adventured to take under your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; that I muſt remit you back, to what was then ſaid. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now, I take notice of your ludibrious confirmation, of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter branch of your <hi>Dilemma, viz.</hi> that, if we cannot prove antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that the Clergie hath aſſiſtance, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give the true ſenſe of Scripture, then it is impoſſible, that our Clergie can give the true ſenſe: Becauſe, it is impoſſible to doe any thing, <hi>In actu ſecunde,</hi> without a ſpeciall abilitie, <hi>In actu primo.</hi> It is a wonder to me, how ever ſuch a Childiſh conſequence, could drop from the pen of one, who wold be reputed a Scholer.

Becauſe I cannot infallibly prove, you to be <hi>Mr. Dempſter, the Ieſuit,</hi> Doth it therfore follow, that you are not he? who but a child wold conclude, that, becauſe I cannot prove <hi>Antecedenter, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi> that ſuch a Doctor of the Church, hath an aſſiſtance <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give the true ſenſe of Scripture, therefore, he hath it not?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101081:45"/>The Spirit breaths on whome, and where he pleaſes. The aſſiſting influence of the Spirit, may be given, when I cannot demonſtrat <hi>A prtori,</hi> that ſuch a one hath it, <hi>Hic &amp; nunc.</hi> But ſureſt arguings in ſuch caſes, are, <hi>A poſteriori,</hi> from the effect. Such an one hath given the true ſenſe of Scripture, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he had the aſſiſtance of the Spirit to give it. Had you but conſulted with your Romaniſts Principles, you would have found, that you were under a neceſſity to acknowledge the truth of this. For you pretend not to conclude peremptorily, and antecedently of any Doctors of your Church, that they have this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> for giving the true ſenſe of Scripture, except of your <hi>Pope in Cathedra, and generall Councills,</hi> yea ſome of your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors dare not conclude ſo much of them. Will you the refore ſay, that none beſide the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the generall <hi>Councills,</hi> can give the true ſenſe of Scripture? You cannot prove antecedently, by any <hi>Medium,</hi> that <hi>Toſtatus, Toletus, Pererius, Eſthius, A Lapide,</hi> &amp;c. had aſſiſtance, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give the true ſenſe of Scripture, For none of theſe were <hi>Popes.</hi> Nay, nor can it be proven, <hi>A priori,</hi> that <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the root of your miſtake, is, that you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, the objective ground, on which our belief to ſuch a truth is built, muſt be the Perſwaſion, We have, that ſuch a Doctor, is guided by ſuch an infallible aſſiſtance, which is a manifeſt untruth. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I pray you, is that perſwaſion grounded? That muſt ſurely have another foundation. But becauſe you had ſo often inſinuated this, therefore I did appeal you, and againe doe appeal you, to produce Grounds for this pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your Clergie; or elſe, I will take your ſilence, for an evident deſertion of your cauſe.</p>
               <p>Your laſt brawl is, becauſe I had ſaid, that what ever ſolid Grounds were brought by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the reſt of the ancient <hi>Apologiſts,</hi> to prove the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, or are to be found, in the late Tractats of <hi>Morney, Grotius, Amyrald,</hi> and <hi>Vives, De veritate Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Chriſtianae,</hi> Theſe alſo prove the truth of the Religion of PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANTS. <hi>Who</hi> (ſay you,) <hi>will not laugh at this anſwere, as if

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS your fourth Paper, carying the date of the ninth of <hi>June,</hi> came to my hands the twelth of <hi>June,</hi> and in it you make a more ample muſter of your ordinar digreſſions, contumelies, and miſapplyed Eruditions, though you know, that the better ſort eſteems this weak-mens weapons, and clear teſtimonies of a deſerted cauſe, but it ſeems all one to you, if by this means you can uphold your reputation with the Vulgar ſort, who ſeeing you blot ſo much Paper, remains in conceit, that you retaine ſtill your poſt. If I had the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to render me worthie of your friendſhip, I would in a homelie, and friendly manner, ſuggeſt to you a compendious way to spare Paper; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving onely thir three omiſſions. Firſt, that you omit all exeur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions out of the way, that is to ſay, that you omit all theſe things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naming of the which, the preſent controverſie may be fully deeyded. Secondly, that you omit all contumelies, and undervalueing words, as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101081:48"/>more beſetting a ſcolding Wife then a Scholer. Thirdly, that you omit all theſe things which cannot favour your Religion, but with this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that in the ſame degree, in the which it favours you, it muſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and ſhelter a falſe Religion, and which is holden by your ſelves for a falſe Religion. And I hope, that you will grant thir things, to be very rationallie demanded of you: ſince it is known, that there is a great difference to be put, betwixt the handling of a controverſie in a Pulpit, where one railes at randome, having none to contradict him, and the handling of it in a School way, where you muſt foot your bowle, and hold you within the ſcore; under the paine to be exploded. Now if you will be pleaſed to obſerve thir three things. which are ſo rationally demanded, I oblige my ſelf to make it good, that you will not be able to put ten lines in Paper, which ſhall be judged to make to the purpoſe in the preſent controverſie. And for proofe hereof. you may be pleaſed to take all your foure Papers, miſaplyed as they are, ſqueeze them, and ſee if you expreſſe out of them thir ten lines, taking firſt away, thir three things, to wit, Digreſſions about other matters. Contumelies, and baſe flyting words, and things that cannot favour your cauſe without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring in the like degree a falſe Religion. And ſince it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that none can expreſſe more ſubstance out of your own Papers, nor your ſelf, it is expected of you that after you have taken the pains, to blow away all this chaffe; you will ſhow, that there remains greater quantity of ſolid corne upon the floore, then can be contained in ten lines of Paper.</p>
               <p>That it may appeare, how farr you wander out of the way, you must be content to have patience, that the maine point be laid alway againe and againe before you, which is, the Proteſtant Religion cannot be the True Religion, or the Religion to the which, GOD hath tyed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternall life, and conſequently, whoſoever aime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> at eternall happineſſe after this life, or intends to ſave his ſoul, is obliged to quit it and to betake himſelfe to a diligent ſearch for the true Religion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcinding for now, where it is to be found, and inſiſting only for the preſent, that the Proteſtant Religion is it not. This is both a ſubſtantiall point, and proponed in ſo clear terms, that none can but underſtand it. And it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101081:48"/>is proven by this one Syllogiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <list>
                     <item>That Religion cannot be a True Religion, which hath no ſpeciall grounds or principles, to prove it ſelf to be a True Religion, or a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD.</item>
                     <item>But the Protestant Religion, hath no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grounds or principles, whereby it can prove it ſelf to be a True Religion, or to be a Religion conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Proteſtant Religion cannot be a True Religion.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>To this Syllogiſme you anſwered firſt, cavilling the forme of it, as componed of two premiſſes negatives, and ſo concluding nothing. But in this you diſcover groſſe ignorance, confounding and calling negative propoſitions, affirmative premiſſes of objective negations. Next you come to deny the ſubſumption, that is, you deny that the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath no ſpeciall grounds to prove it ſelf to be a True Religion, or to be a Religion, conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD. And you adde, that ſince the ſubſumption is denyed by you; it is my part who is the <hi>Opponent,</hi> to prove it. Let it be ſo. But hath it not been ſufficiently proven, first, Becauſe, if it have any good grounds, they are produceable, but they are not produceable, or elſe produce them. Next, hath it not been often inculcat, and is now of new inculcat, that the Proteſtant Religion hath no speciall grounds or principles, to prove it ſelf to be conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, but ſuch
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101081:49"/>that with as great reaſon may ſerve to prove a falſe Religion, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture. Ergo, it hath no true principles or grounds, becauſe a true principle is not of an indifferent nature, but is ſo determinat to truth, that it cannot protect nor ſhelter any error. Now, that it may appear, that all the principles, or grounds, which you bring to prove the truth of your Religion, are indifferent, and conſequently, cannot be true principles, we ſhall runne them over and lay them open to the view of all.</p>
               <p>The firſt ground you produced is, that your Religion hath objective truth, and objective ground, or evidence, and can ſufficiently ſhow, and prove it ſelf to have this truth, upon condition that it encounter with a well dispoſed intellect. But all this may be aſſumed, and is aſſumed by a falſe Religion; or aſſigne ſome reaſon, wherefore you have right to aſſume it, and they not.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that your Religion is eaſily known to be a true Religion, by applying and confronting the tenets of it with the Word of God, as a man is eaſily known to be an honeſt man, be confronting his actions with the Law; as likewiſe, a line is eaſily known to be ſtraight, and not crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the conformity it is ſeen to have with a right rule. But what falſe Religion is there, that doth not apply all this to themſelves, with as great reaſon as you doe. And though the letter of Scripture, is of it ſelf, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable onely of one genuine ſenſe, to wit, which was intended by the holy Ghoſt, which is all the ſhift which you adde now in this last Paper. But what makes this for you, ſince you bring no reaſon, whereby may appeare, that the ſenſe which you give to the letter of Scripture, is that one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe intended be the holy Ghost, or that the ſenſe which you give, is that right rule, by the which all crookedneſſe is to be known? You think it is enough to ſay thir things, without any proofe, as if a Religion, which you your ſelves gives out for a falſe Religion, did not with as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone pretend all this for themſelves.</p>
               <p>The third is, that Religion is not an individuall truth, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex of many truths, which cannot be proven altogether but one after another. As a man who hath a hundred pices of Gold, and would prove whether they be upright Gold or not, this proofe cannot be done, but by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101081:49"/>bringing every one of them to the Touch-stone. But this likewiſe may be aſſumed, with as great reaſone by a falſe Religion, or aſſigne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not uſe this ſhift as well as you, when they are required, to give ſome ground for the truth of their Religion.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that the grounds which <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the holy Fathers brings to prove the truth of Chriſtian Religion againſt Pag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes, proves likewiſe the truth of your Proteſtant Religion. But this with as great reaſon may be aſſumed by any Chriſtian falſe Religion, or ſhow wherefore not.</p>
               <p>The fifth that you adde in this Paper now is this, that the perſpicuity of Scripture in all things neceſſarie to Salvation, is a ground to prove the truth of the Proteſtant Religion. But though this were true, what makes it more for the truth of your Religion, nor for the truth of a falſe Religion, ſince they with as great reaſon as you, may and does pretend, that the tenets which they hold as neceſſar to Salvation, are clearly contained in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, you have been often preſſed to produce grounds, whereby might be ſhowen, that your Clergie hath <hi>In actu primo,</hi> ſome peculiar aſſiſtance to give <hi>In actu ſecundo,</hi> the true ſenſe of texts of Scripture, which doeth not prove the like aſſiſtance, to the Clergie of a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So that in handling of Scripture, you are all one with them, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more aſſiſtance to handle it rightly then they have. As to that which you adde now in this Paper, that this ſenſe, which is given by a Doctor to a text of Scripture, may be the true ſenſe, though neither he, nor others reflect or know any thing of the habilitie that he hath <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give this true ſeuſe, for, <hi>Spiritus ubi vult ſpirat.</hi> But though this anſwer wer to the purpoſe, may it not be aſſumed with as gryt reaſone in favour of a falſe Religion. Next, you force me to diſcover the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſſe of the diſcourſe that you make here, becauſe it ſeems, you onely intend to induce a plauſable and glittering ſcroofe upon things, to dazle the eyes of ſimple people, not earing what ſtuffely under. For the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, is not, whether a thing may be truelie ſuch in it ſelf, though I doe not know it to be ſuch, nor knows any thing of the cauſes whereof the truth of it depends, ſince things are ſuch and ſuch in themſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101081:50"/>they be known or not known by us. Neither is the queſtion about matters of <hi>Science,</hi> where objective evidence convicts the underſtanding to aſſent, and that independently of all authority of the Proponer. But the queſtion is, about matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> where all the motive to induce one to beleeve a thing, is reduced to the authority of the Speaker, and according to the divers degrees, that are found in the authority of theſe that ſpeakes a thing, ſo are the correſpondent degrees of firmnes in the aſſents whereby the hearer beleeves ſuch things, and becauſe, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of GOD is a ſupreame authority, and above all other authorities, therefore the aſſent that is due to ſuch authority, when it speakes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals any thing, muſt have a firmnes, above the firmnes which other aſſents have, and which we give to matters proponed onely by inferiour autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. Now I ask, how can people be induced to exerce one Act of faith, or to beleeve with that firmnes which is due onely when GOD ſpeakes or reveals a thing, if they be not firſt aſſured that GOD ſpeakes by the mouth of ſuch a man, and conſequently, that ſuch a man hath ſufficient aſſiſtance and direction <hi>In actu primo;</hi> that he cannot deceive nor speake one thing for another. Now, you are required to produce ſome ſpeciall ground, whereby the people may be aſſured, that their Clergie who ſhould inſtruct them in matters of faith, hath this aſſiſtance <hi>In actu primo,</hi> and which is neceſſar if they would beget ſuperuaturall faith in their hearers, that is to ſay, Such a beleefe whereby the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers doe adhere above all, to the things that are proponed to them, as revealed by GOD in ſuch texts of Scripture, otherwiſe it will follow that the aſſiſtance which you have does not exceed the aſſiſtance which the Clergie of a falſe Religion have; and conſequently, that preach what you will, and though you rune over the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> you will never be able by your preaching, to produce ſo much, as an ſol Act of ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faith in your hearers.</p>
               <p>Out of all this appears, at what poor poſture you have reduced the truth of your Religion, notwithſtanding, that in the begining, you did ſo bragingly undertake to mantaine the truth thereof, before whomſoever, againſt whomſoever, and in whatſomever place. And likewiſe to this effect, have spent and blotted ſo much Paper, ſince all ends in this, that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101081:50"/>your Religion is indeed true, but ſo, that it cannot be ſhown wherein it differs from a falſe Religion, as if one had taken in hand, the defenſe of the honeſtie of a man, and after long pleading at the barre, and brought the matter to this paſſe, that he were declared to be indeed an honeſt man, but ſuch an honeſt man, that there were no ſeemable difference betwixt him and a knave.</p>

               <p>Your frequent repeating, and glorying in this ludicrous Syllogiſme, tempts me, to diſcover more of its vitioſirie, then once I intended. Though I for brevity, did onely deny the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> and did require no more from you, but the probation thereof, yet I might have deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both <hi>Major,</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Concluſion</hi> alſo. I ſay, firſt, I might have denyed the <hi>Major.</hi> For the True Religion, and the true ſenſe of Scripture is the ſame. What is the True Religion, but the true Doctrine of Salvation? And is not the true ſenſe of Scripture the true Doctrine of Salvation? Now muſt the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have a ground to prove that it is conforme to it own ſelf? So, that your <hi>Major,</hi> which I did let paſſe, might juſtly have been queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Next I denyed the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> becauſe, Religion or the Doctrine of Salvation, may be conſidered under a double notion, either as revealed in Scripture, or as profeſſed by men. Under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer notion, it is the very true ſenſe of Scripture, and ſo to prove it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101081:52"/>to be conforme to the ſenſe of Scripture, were to prove it to be conforme to it own ſelf, and that <hi>Sub eadem formaliratione.</hi> But under the latter conſideration, namly, as profeſſed by us, the truth of Religion may admit of ſuch a probation, as when the truth of an <hi>Apograph,</hi> is proven by its conformity to the <hi>Aute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph,</hi> or the truth of a <hi>Tranſumpt,</hi> by its conformity to the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</hi> Nay, laſtly I added, that I might have denyed the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;</hi> becauſe of the informalitie of the whole ſtructure, which you have been endeavouring to palliat, by your formall and objective negations, yet have you not been able to ſalve. May you not by all this diſcerne, that your gloriation hath been <hi>De re nibili,</hi> yea in your own ſhame?</p>
               <p>You ſubjoine a piece of notable Pageantrie. For though hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you have been declying to prove the aſſumption of your <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> yet now with a braſen fore-head, you affirme you have proven it, and that oftner then once. But how I pray you? Becauſe forſooth, you have here twiſe magiſterially affirmed, that there can be no grounds of the truth of the Religion of PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANTS produced, which cannot be verified of a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and theſe your two affirmations, you hold for two learned probations. But are not your affirmations, Synonyma's, upon the matter with the denyed aſſumption, and equally in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with it? Think you us ſo ſimple, as to beleeve your aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe you doe once and againe, affirme it to be true? Then indeed, you might conclud us, as well as your ſelf to be,

               </p>
               <p>At leaſt, you could not be ignorant, that I would deſider at a probation of your <hi>Affirmations,</hi> as well as of the denyed <hi>Aſſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And it hath been often told you, that by rules of diſputing, you could not ty me to produce <hi>Grounds</hi> of the truth of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; you being the <hi>Opponent,</hi> and having affirmed, that there is a true Religion, which hath peculiar <hi>Grounds,</hi> competible to no falſe Religion.

                     </gap>.</hi> Conſider therefore this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either you acknowledge that there is a true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, having peculiar and reciprocall Grounds, which can be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of no falſe Religion or not. If not, then it is not onely the Religion of PROTESTANTS, which you impugne, but all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and it is <hi>Atheiſme</hi> which you goe about to eſtabliſh. If therefore you grant, that there is a True Religion, which hath theſe peculiar and reciprocall Grounds, let them be produced, and let it be examined, whether they doe agree to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of PROTESTANTS or <hi>Romaniſts. Hic Rhodus, hic Saltus.</hi> Had you not diſtruſted your cauſe, you could not being the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, have ſhifted this ſo long.</p>
               <p>But to put a more ſpeedie period to this controverſie, I had condeſcended, to mention to you Grounds of the truth of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of PROTESTANTS, which are not really competible to any falſe Religion, however they may be pretended too. It is hard to me to tell, whether in your enumeration of them, or in your ludicrous way of confutation, you manifeſt more Childiſh weakneſſe and folly.</p>
               <p>And firſt, in the enumeration of the grounds of Religion, you number up five, more indeed, then ever I gave you. For the firſt two, namly, the <hi>Intrinſick objective evidence</hi> of Religion, and <hi>The conformity thereof to the word of GOD,</hi> were never mentioned by me as two diſtinct grounds; yea, your ſelf in your third Paper, reckoned theſe as <hi>Synonima's,</hi> and therefore, you but play the child in reckoning them as diſtinct. Neither is the fifth ground which you mention, concerning <hi>The perspicuity of the Scriptures,</hi> to be adequatly diſtinguiſhed from theſe. But your cheife prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, in that which you mention, as the <hi>Third ground</hi> of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101081:53"/>truth of our Religion, namly, that Religion being a complex of many divine truth, cannot be all proven at once, but by compating each of theſe truths with the word of GOD. I could not have expected, that a man who was not in a perfect <hi>Delirinm,</hi> could have bewrayed ſuch ſtupidity, for this was never laid down by me, as a Ground of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Nay a Child might have diſcerned by the very terms, that this was onely brought as a reaſon, why in ſuch a ſhort Paper, I could not be tyed to give you the grounds of our Religion. For it were to tye me, as matters are now ſtated, to writ a whole bodie of controverſies. What an impudent cheat then is this, you would put upon your Reader, to ſubſtitute that, as a Ground of the truth of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſſigned by me, which in very deed was brought by me as a reaſon, why I was not tyed at this time, to give you any grounds? Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth therefore, when you goe to impugne any thing in my Papers, propoſe it in my own terms, elſe I muſt ſay to you in the words of the Poet.</p>
               <q>Quem recitas meus eſt, O Fidentine, libellus, Sed malè dum recitas, incipit eſſe tuus.</q>
               <p>You diſcover no leſſe weakneſſe, in your trifling confutation, of theſe grounds of Religion, for all ye ſay to every one of them, which five times you doe repeat, is that a falſe Religion may alleage all theſe grounds. But herein, you play the ſilly Sophiſter, <hi>Ab ignoratione elen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> for the queſtion is not, whether the PROTESTANT or true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hath grounds, which a falſe Religion may not alleage or pretend, but whether the PROTESTANT Religion hath grounds, which cannot be verified of a falſe Religion? I freely grant, that a falſe Religion, may lay claime to the grounds of the true Religion, as the mad man of <hi>Athens,</hi> laid claime to all the Ships that came into the Harbout as his own, though none of them were his. But the Grounds of the true Religion, can never be verified of a falſe Religion. It was not enough then for you, to ſay, that a falſe Religion, may lay claime to thoſe Grounds, nay, nor was it to the purpoſe, unleſſe you could alſo have ſhewed, that the Ground of the PROTESTANT Religion, namely, <hi>Conformity with the Scripture,</hi> might be verified of a falſe Religion.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101081:53"/>This you ought to have ſhowen, if you had intended a real confutation of my grounds. But this you will find as impoſſible for you, as to remove the Earth from its <hi>Axis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you looke againe, to my laſt Paper, you will finde, that in ſtead of theſe <hi>Five grounds,</hi> of your muſtering, I gave only theſe <hi>Two grounds,</hi> from which indeed, the truth of the Religion of PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS, and the falſhood of the preſent Romiſh Religion, may be diſcovered. The firſt was, <hi>The perspicuity of the Scripture, in all things neceſſarie to Salvation,</hi> which I did confirme by luculent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, which you have not once dared to examine. The other was, <hi>From our Agreement in eſſentials, with the faith of the pureſt, and moſt Ancient primitive Church, in the firſt three Centuries.</hi> And with all, from this I deduced, a demonſtration of the falſhood, of your now Romiſh Church, and Religion, from the diſcrepancy thereof in eſſentials, from the faith of the Catholick Church, in the firſt three Centuries; which I confirmed from your <hi>Formula Fidei,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh Creed,</hi> contrived by <hi>Pope Pius the fourth,</hi> which differs in its eſſentials, from the faith of the Church, in the firſt three Centuries. Had you been willing, that imparriall ſearch ſhould be made, whether the truth ſtood on your ſide, or on ours, Had you not here matter enough to work upon, both from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Antiquity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But diſſembling all my arguments from theſe principles, you onely give this ſnifling <hi>Anſwere,</hi> that they who have a falſe Religion, may alſo pretend, that their Religion is alſo contained in Scripture, and is conforme to the Religion of the primitive Church. To which I <hi>Reply</hi> firſt, that theſe forementioned grounds, doe not ceaſe to be grounds, for proving the True Religion, becauſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> pretend an intereſt in them. Nay on the contrary, Hereticks laying claime to them, is a ſtrong perſumption, that they are the induitable grounds of the true Religion, as a Rogues pretending conformity with the Law, is ſo farr from proving, that the Law is no diſcriminating <hi>Teſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Honeſtie and Roguery, that it is rather, a vehement preſumption of the con-ratie. Secondly, Had you reſolved to goe to the borrome of the buſines, you ſhould have proved, that either theſe grounds aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101081:54"/>by me, are not proper grounds, for the diſcerning the True Religion, from a falſe; or that theſe grounds doeth really agree to a falſe Religion, that is, <hi>That a falſe Religion is perspicuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, and doth agree in its eſſentials, with the Religion of the primitive Church, in the firſt three Centuries,</hi> or that theſe grounds, doe not agree to the Religion of PROTESTANTS. But none of theſe doe you once attempt to performe. Nay over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, you are put to prove any of theſe, which if you doe, <hi>Tu Phillida ſolus habeto.</hi> But thirdly, I demonſtrate on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratie, that theſe are ſure grounds, by which the truth of Religion may be diſcerned, Thus, if Scripture be not a ſufficient ground, and <hi>Teſt,</hi> to diſtinguiſh a true Religion from a falſe, then it muſt be, either becauſe, it doth not containe <hi>All things,</hi> neceſſary to Salvation, or becauſe, it doth not hold out <hi>Perſpicuouſly</hi> all theſe things, for there is no other impediment imaginable, unleſſe with the Infidell, you ſhould queſtion the <hi>Authority</hi> of Scriptures. But when we ſay, that the Scripture is the indubitable <hi>Teſt,</hi> for diſcerning the True Religion, from a falſe, it is to be underſtood among Chriſtians, who acknowledge the divine <hi>Authoritie</hi> of Scriptures. Conſequently, if the Scriptures be <hi>Perspicuous in all things neceſſary to Savlation,</hi> (as our Divines have often demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I cleared in my laſt, by irrefragable teſtimonies, both of <hi>Ancients,</hi> and of your own <hi>Doctors,</hi>) then it muſt be a ſufficient ground, and <hi>Teſt,</hi> to diſcerne a True Religion from a falſe. Your cavill concerning the ambiguity of Scriptures, is frivolous. For, if Scripture had not ſufficient objective grounds, (means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation being duely uſed,) to clear its own genuine ſenſe, in all things neceſſarie to Salvation, then were it not <hi>Perspicuous</hi> which is againſt the <hi>Hyphotheſis</hi> laid down, againſt which you have not adventured to move one <hi>Objection.</hi> So that ſtill it holds, that if Scripture be perſpicuous in all things neceſſarie to Salvation, it muſt be a ſufficient ground, and teſt, to diſcerne a True Reilgion from a falſe. What therefore remains, but that either you ſhow the Scriptures not to be clear, in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101081:54"/>to Salvation, or elſe, that both the Religion of PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS, and Papiſts, be brought to this <hi>Test,</hi> and examined, which of them are really conforme thereunto. But next, as to the other ground, I argue thus. Either the faith of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, in the firſt <hi>Three Centuries,</hi> was the True Chriſtian Religion, or not. If not, then there was no true Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion at all, <hi>Abſit blaſphemia.</hi> If it was, then what accords with it in its eſſentials, muſt be the True Chriſtian Religion; and on the contrary, what differs from it in eſſentials, cannot be the true Chriſtian Religion, and therefore here againe I appeal you, either to ſhow an eſſential difference, betwixt the ancient True Chriſtian Religion in theſe ages, and ours, or, that there is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in eſſentials, betwixt the ancient Religion in theſe ages, &amp; your <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, as it is expreſſed in that <hi>Formula fidei</hi> of <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth, or elſe to acknowledge, that the Religion of PROTESTANTS, is the True Religion, and that your <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion is but a <hi>Farrago</hi> of falſhoods, and Innovations, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In your penult ſection, you whiſle like a child, concerning the Clergies aſſiſtance <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to give the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and you call upon me, to prove that our Clergie hath ſuch an aſſiſtance. As if it were a point of our faith, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Clergies infallible aſſiſtance, (for of that onely you muſt be underſtood,) were a neceſſary prerequiſite, before the true ſenſe of Scripture can be known. But have I not often told you, that this is denyed by us, and alſo often appealed you, if you could to prove it, elſe I would hold it for confeſſed that you could not doe it. But to call you to your duety, is, <hi>Surdo canere.</hi> Yea, from this your aſſertion, concerning the knowledge of the Clergies aſſiſtance, I have ſhowed you to be encircled in an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable <hi>Contradiction,</hi> from which, you have never attempted to expede your ſelf.

Suppoſe that <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Sempronius</hi> ſtood at the barre, and that <hi>Titius</hi> acclaimed the monopolie of <hi>Honesty</hi> to himſelf. And withall, accuſed his Neighbour <hi>Sempronius</hi> as a verie <hi>Knave;</hi> becauſe, (as <hi>Titius</hi> alleag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) he could produce no grounds to prove his <hi>Hareſtie.</hi> On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, <hi>Sempronius</hi> modeſtly ſhew how eaſie it were to recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, and retote all theſe accuſations upon <hi>Titius.</hi> Yet though he might have deſired <hi>Titius,</hi> as the <hi>Accuſer,</hi> to prove his indytment, or
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101081:55"/>elſe, to ſuffer <hi>Secundum Legem talionis,</hi> and to be eſteemed as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand <hi>Knave;</hi> yet, he would condeſcend ſo far, as to give Grounds by which his <hi>Honeſty</hi> might be proven. But with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that both he, and his <hi>Accuſer Titius,</hi> might be brought to the <hi>Teſt,</hi> that the World might ſee, who was the <hi>Rogue,</hi> and who the <hi>Honeſt-Man.</hi> The firſt Ground to which <hi>Sempronius</hi> appeales, is the Law, proteſting that both he and his Accuſer <hi>Titius,</hi> may be judged by that <hi>Rule.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Teſt,</hi> to which <hi>Sempronius</hi> referres himſelf, for tryall, <hi>Is the practiſe and example of men of untainted Honeſtie,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Ariſtides, Fabricius, Cato, &amp;c.</hi> Proteſting likewiſe, that he be ſtigmatized as the <hi>Rogue,</hi> whoſe converſation ſhall be found diſcrepant from theirs. <hi>Tïtius,</hi> though at firſt a bold <hi>Accuſer,</hi> yet not able to endure ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate a tryall, ſtudies all the ſubterfuges his poor wit could invent. And firſt, he declines the Law, alleaging it could not be the Ground of tryall: becauſe it is ambiguous, and admits of diverſe and contrarie ſenſes; nor can any give the ſenſe of the Law, except he be <hi>Iufallible.</hi> Which gift of Infallibility, <hi>Titius</hi> would have all men to beleeve, though he cannot prove it, to be peculiar to himſelf alone, ſo as no ſenſe of the Law may be admitted, but that which he homologates. And for the example of <hi>Ariſtides, Fabricius,</hi> and <hi>Cato, &amp;c.</hi> They are too ſtrict Paterns for <hi>Titius;</hi> yet not dareing openly to condemne them, he makes this evaſion. What Knave, ſayes he, is there, that may not pretend conformitie both with theſe, and alſo with the <hi>Law?</hi> But <hi>Sempronius</hi> gravely anſwers, that however Knaves might pretend conformity both to the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Practiſes of Good-Men,</hi> yet they had it not. And againe, he ſolemnly proteſts that the matter might be put to exact tryall, whether the Accuſers or his converſation were agreeable to the Law, and theſe untainted Paterns of <hi>Honeſty,</hi> and withall added, that it was an intolerable reproach, thrown both upon the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Lawgivers, that a Law was given to people to walk by, which no man except <hi>Titius,</hi> with his pretended infallibilitie, could underſtand. Is it not ſtrange (ſaid <hi>Sempronius,</hi>) that my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer <hi>Titius,</hi> can ſpeake his accuſation ſo intelligibly, that a Child can underſtand the ſenſe thereof; and yet that our Lawgivers had
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101081:56"/>not ſo much wit, as to expreſſe the Laws, which they would have to be the Rule of our lives, in intelligible language? What prudent Senators, would ſuffer themſelves, and Lawgivers, thou to be reflected upon by <hi>Titius,</hi> and would not, for his pleading after this manner, condemne him as a petulant Rogue? The application af this <hi>Embleme</hi> is left to you, and to the judicious Reader.</p>
               <p>I have made ſo many experiments upon you, that if there had been any <hi>Mercurie</hi> in you, in all probabilitie, before this time it had been extracted; but the longer I deal with you, the greater Dounce doe you appear. I am both wearied, and aſhamed, to graple further with one, who multiplies ſuch Childiſh imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies, and notorious falſhoods. Leaſt therefore I ſhould ſeeme, <hi>Cum Cretenſi Cretizare,</hi> I diſcharge any further exchange of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers with you, except you change your ſtraine.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe I know the <hi>Genius</hi> of many of your Party to be ſuch that if you tranſmitted to me a <hi>Rapſody</hi> of perfect <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> to which no anſwere were returned, you would glory, as if you had approven your ſelf, as a <hi>Doctor Irrefragabilis.</hi> Therefore, to put a check to this inſolencie, and withall, to ſatisfie the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, I adde two things.

But in this Paper, deboarding mor then ever, you give cleir teſtimony, that all your ſtrength conſiſts in thir things. So that the confyning of you within thir limits, wer to diſarme you altogether, and to bind up all the fecundity, which you have to blot Paper, and multiply words, for hyding your weakeneſſe. Laying aſid then all things of whatſoewer ſort that ar out of the line, I lay befor you againe the maine point, to wit, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, cannot be the true religion, nor the Religion to the which GOD hath tyed the promiſe of eternall life, and conſequently, whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aims at eternal happineſſe after this life, or intends to ſave his ſoul, is oblidged in conſcience to quit it, and to betake himſelf to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſearch for the truth, preſcinding for now, whair it is to be found, inſisting for the preſent in this only, that the Proteſtant Religion cannot be it. This cannot be called a nonſenſe, ſince its both an moſt ſubſtantial point, and likewiſe proponed to you in ſuch cleir terms. It is proven by this one Sylogiſme,

                     <item>That Religion cannot be a true Religion, which hath no speciall grounds, whereby it can prove it ſelf to be a true Religion, or to be a Religion conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD.</item>
                     <item>But the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion hath no speciall grounds, whereby it can prove it ſelf to be the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or to be a Religion conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD.</item>

               </p>
               <p>To this Syllogiſme, yow anſwered first, carping the forme of it, as if it wer of tuo premiſſes negatives and though it was ſhowen yow yowr groſſ ignorance in this, calling affirmative propoſitions, negations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus they ar of objective negations, yet now yow add with alſe gryt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that the concluſion is negative. Is it poſſible that an Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi in Iſrael is ſo ignorant, that there moſt be made to him a leſſon of <hi>Summules</hi> to make him capable to diſcerne betwixt affirmative and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative propoſitions? Here indeed would come in ſeaſon, a way for ſham, and ſuch hiſſing and histrionicall expreſſions as yow uſe now and then in yowr Papers. Next yow ſay, that though hithertoo, yow have onlie denyed the ſubſumption, yet yow have acquired, by the benefit of ſo long a time, a new light which diſcovers a defect alſo in the Major. But this argues that the Sylogiſme is not of ſo obvious a nakednes, as yow ſtylled it, ſince a man of yowr capacity hath need of ſo long tyme to acquire light for the diſcoverte of the defects of it. But giving and not granting, that there wer defects in the Major, yet ſince yow have ingaged yowr ſelf, in denying the ſubſumption long agoe, and ſo incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an obligation, to produce grounds for the truth of yowr Religion, yow muſt firſt end this, before yow begin the other, either confeſſing that yow have no grounds, or elſe producing them; that they may be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned whether they ſubſist or not. And here I cannot but commend yowr ingenuity in that yow confeſſe cleirly, that all the things that yow have spoken hithertoo, in ſo long lybells, ar not true grounds, but onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſhow, that yow wer not obliged, to produce grounds, for the truth of yowr Religion; and ſo yow <hi>Diſowne, and recant them all</hi> as taken under this formalitie. But let them be called as yow pleaſe, either grounds or ſhifts, to diſoblige yow from producing of grounds, yet the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſwell for an falſe Religion, as for yowr own.</p>
               <p>After yow have <hi>Diſclaimed and recalled</hi> under the formalitie of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101081:58"/>grounds all things that yow ſo copionſtie have spkoken of hithertoo, <hi>Now you prodoce your Achilles,</hi> in which yow profeſſe that yow will own as a ground of the truth of yowr Religion, to wit, <hi>Scripture taken as containing perſpicuouſly all things neceſſarie to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. So that Scripture taken under this formalitie, is the onely ground diſtinctive of your Religion, from all falſe Religion</hi> But let us goe on here ſofilie, that it may appeare better the juglings that lurbs under this anſwere, and the labyrinth and obſcuritie that yow have involved yowr ſelf in. For firſt, by Scripture of which yow affirme, that it is a diſtinctive of yowr Religion, from all falſe Religion, muſt be underſtood the letter of Scripture taken in the true and genuine ſenſe intended by the holy Ghoſt. So that to containe all things neceſſarie to Salvation, with perſpicuitie is affirmed of the letter of Scripture, taken with this true ſenſe, as contradistinguiſhed from all falſe ſenſe. Ergo it cannot ſerve for a diſtinctive ground, of yowr Religion, from all falſe Religions, except first yow prove, that the ſenſe, which yow give to the letter of Scripture, is that true and genuine ſenſe intended by the holy Ghost, and that all other ſenſes, which doe not coincide with yours are falſe and erronious. Becauſe according to your ſelf, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not a ground to diſtinguiſh your Religion from a falſe Religion, but in ſo farr as it is ſuppoued to containe, (and that with perſpicuitie,) all things neceſſarie to Salvation, and againe it does not containe this, but ſo farr as it ſuppons, and is taken for the letter of Scripture, with the true and genuine ſenſe. Now I ask, how can you aſſume the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture, taken with the true ſenſe; for a ground to prove your Religion to be true, and to be diſtinguiſhed by this from a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Except firſt, yow ſhow with pregnant and convincing reaſons, that this ſenſe, which yow give to the letter of Scripture, is that true genuine ſenſe intended by the holy Ghoſt? Neither does it avail yow, that which yow now here infinuate, that the ſenſe which yow give, muſt be the true ſenſe, <hi>For the conformitie it hath with the ſenſe holden by the Church in the firſt three Centuries.</hi> Becauſe this claime to Amiquity is common to all Sexts. And ſo yow cannot mak vſe of it, except firſt, yow bring ſome ſolid reaſon, to prove your claime to be more
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101081:58"/>juſt then theirs. Secondly, I ask yow, how can yow affirme ſo boldly, that all things neceſſarie to Salvation ar contained and that perſpicuouſly in Scripture, except firſt, yow draw up <hi>A liſt or a catalogue of all things that are neceſſarie to Salvation,</hi> as contradiſtinguiſhed from all other things not neceſſarie, and whereof a great pairt ar likewiſe eleirly contained in Scripture, and Scripture it ſelf makes no mentione to diſtinguiſh the one from the other? For according to the rules, yow gave your ſelf, it cannot be but blindlings affirmed, <hi>That all the peices of Gold that one hath in his purſe, ar upright Gold, except they be all produced to be tryed:</hi> Thirdly you ſay, that all things neceſſarie to Salvation, are perspicuouſly in Scripture, but with this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, and ſuppoſition, <hi>That the means for the interpretation be duely uſed,</hi> ſo that Scripture is not of it ſelf alone ſo perspicuous in all things neceſſar to Salvation, except there interveene the due uſe of certaine middes to attaine to the true ſenſe of Scripture. But heir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine yow plunge your ſelf in a new labyrinth of obſcuritie, for I ask, what ar thir means, and what you mean by the due uſe of them? And whether the people without your preaching, can duely uſe thir means, &amp; by the due uſe of them, attaine to the knowledge of all things, neceſſar to Salvation, as well as your Clergie men can doe? whether, a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and acknowledged by your ſelf to be a falſe Religion, may not uſe duely thir middes aswell as yow? Now I know all thir things, will be called by yow nonſenſe, childiſh things, and not worthie of the ſublimitie of your underſtanding, and ſuch railing will be all the anſwere that I will get.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe when you was asked, whether a man can beleeve a thing to be true, preciſly for this motive, becauſe it is revealed and ſpoken by GOD, unleſſe he be aſſured, that GOD speakes by the mouth of him, that propons ſuch a thing? To this you anſwere here, <hi>That a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may propone and give the true ſenſe of Scripture, and the hearer may have ſufficient ground, to beleeve the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to him, though he have no antecedent knowledge, coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him, that the Proponer hath ſuch aſſiſtance, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not propone a falſe revelation, in place of a true; as a Iudge
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:101081:59"/>may give the true ſenſe of a municipall Law, and the hearer may have ſufficient ground to beleeve that the ſenſe given is the true ſenſe, though he have no antecedent knowledge, that the Judge hath infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſiſtance.</hi> But in this anſwere yow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> your ſelf altogether <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi> of the nature of ſupernaturall faith. Since ſupernaturall faith is not everie ſort of aſſent and adheſion, but an aſſent above all things, and an adheſion with ſuch firmnes, as can be given onlie to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame authoritie of GOD, when he ſpeakes a thing: Now I aske, how is it poſſible, that the intellect, who in matters of faith hes no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to induce it to aſſent, bot the meer authoritie of the ſpeaker, can produce any aſſent, whereby it adheres above all things, and with all ſort of firmnes to a thing, which it knowes not otherwiſe to be true, bot preciſlie becauſe GOD hes spoken it, and revealed it, except there preceed a knowledge certifying that GGD speakes by the mouth of him, that propones ſuch a thing, and that he cannot deceive him, in ſaying GOD to have spoken a thing, which he hes not spoken, or elſe one would either ſuspend his aſſent, or elſe not give it in that highe degree of firmnes, and adheſion which is neceſſarly required to ſupernaturall faith, and which he is oblidged to give in caſe he knew certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the example which you bring of a Judge giving the ſenſe of the law, confirms manifeſtly, that yow ar altogether <hi>Ignorant,</hi> of the nature of ſupernaturall faith, for the aſſent one gives to the law, exponed by a Judge, is not a ſupreame aſſent, and ſo does not require in him that beleeves, a knowledge of any infallible aſſiſtance, and yet according to the degree of the firmnes of this aſſent, he muſt have a knowledge of a correſpondent ability in the Judge, for otherwiſe, he might beleive with as great firmnes another man, giving the ſenſe of that law, though he knew that he hade little or no skill of law.</p>
               <p>In the end of your Paper yow take the Perſon of a puffed up Goliah, complaining of the weakeneſſe of yowr adverſarie, as an that brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but childiſh nonſenſe againſt yow, and protests that yow will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together leaze this stage, except there be ſubſtitute againes yow, ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But though by this way you provided ſo and ſo, for your own reputation, how doe you provide for the reputation of your Religion, that you leave with this blot and aſperſion, that there can be ſhowen no difference betwixt it and a falſe Religion, and ſo leaves it in the ſame condition, with a man, whoſe honeſtie being called in queſtion, and much pleaded for, did at laſt obtaine a favourable ſentence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was judictallie declared, to be ſuch an honeſt man, that there was no difference betwixt him and a knave.</p>

The other is, that this is given as my <hi>Onely</hi> ground, which are both notorious falſhoods in the matter of fact. For neither was that the only ground, I having alſo given another, <hi>Viz.

Neither was my laſt Paper, the firſt time, that I produced theſe grounds. Have you made lies your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge?

               <p>As for that, which you terme my onely ground, namely, <hi>The Scriptures, as perspicuous in all things neceſſarie,</hi> which by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, you terme my <hi>Achilles,</hi> I have no cauſe to be aſhamed of that ground. <hi>Scripture</hi> hath proven againſt <hi>Atheiſts, Infidels,</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> and will prove againſt you <hi>Romaniſts</hi> alſo, to be a braſen wall.

Onely, that the ſtate of the queſtion betwixt us may be clear; Let it be remembred, firſt, that we doe not affirme, that all Scriptures are <hi>Perspicuous,</hi> and clear, as the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> in their 1. <hi>Marginall Note, on Luke cap.</hi> 6.

And thirdly, that by <hi>Perspicuity,</hi> we doe not means, that all things are expreſly, in ſo many words in Scripture: But, that they are either expreſly in Scripture, or by firme and clear conſequence, are deduceable from it.

Therefore you ſhould have cleared, what kynd of neceſſitie you meaned. For us, we freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge al things neceſſary, either of the wayes, are contained in Scripture, though not with equall clearneſſe: But theſe things, which are of abſolute and indiſpenſable necesſitie to Salvation, are either expreſly revealed in Scripture, or luculently deduceable by firme conſequence, from that which is expreſly revealed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101081:62"/>therein. And of this laſt is our preſent controverſie.</p>
               <p>I have told our Iudgement, but you like a jugler bring <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,</hi> yet doe not tell your judgement, nor I beleeve can you tell the judgement of your Church. I could here have ſet down the diſcrepant opinions of your men in reference to this point, for which I ſhall remit you, to <hi>Gerard, Tom. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lt. Loc. Com. De Script. cap.</hi> 20. §. 422. <hi>&amp;</hi> 423. Where he ſhowes that ſome of you mantaine, all things in Scripture to be obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as your <hi>Rhemiſts, your Divines of Colen, and Caniſius,</hi> but that others grant many things in Scripture, eſpecially theſe that are neceſſarie, to be clear, as <hi>Hieron. ab Oleaſtro, Thomas, Coſterus, Catharinus, &amp;c.</hi> You are therefore required, if you can, to ſet down the judgement of your <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> in this matter, as clearly, as I have done ours. And you may if you will in the entrie conſider this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either you have a Definition of that Church, which you call infallible, againſt the perſpicuity of the Scriptures, or not. If you have it, produce it. Sure I am your <hi>Councill of Trent,</hi> hath paſſed no ſuch Decree, and for what I know, none elſe. If none, then are you a manifeſt wrangler, and you have no certainty of faith, for the <hi>Theſis</hi> which you mantaine. But let you wander in the miſt as you will, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed this to clear the grounds, on which I walke, and ſo I ſhall proceed to examine your <hi>Objections,</hi> which are like ſo many rove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrowes, ſhot without the prefixing of a marke.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, you object, <hi>That the perspicuity of the Scriptures, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve as a distinctive ground of our Religion, from a falſe, except firſt, I prove that the ſenſe which we give of Scripture, is the genuine ſenſe intended by the holy Ghost.</hi> But this precarious and meerly aſſertory <hi>Objection,</hi> may with far more reaſon be inverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſelf. For, if the <hi>Perspicuity of the Scriptures in all things neceſſary,</hi> cannot ſerve as a diſtinctive ground of our Religion, from a falſe, then muſt it either be, becauſe Scripture is not perſpicuous in all things neceſſary, or elſe becauſe the ſenſe given by PROTESTANTS, is not the genuine ſenſe of Scripture, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101081:63"/>conſequently, it was itcumbent to you as the <hi>Opponent,</hi> (who have undertaken in your fourth Paper, <hi>To impugne any ground affigned by me,</hi>) I ſay, it was incumbent to you, either to have proven that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is not perſpicuous in all things neceſſary, or elſe, that the ſenſe given by PROTESTANTS, is not the genuine ſenſe of Scripture. But neither of theſe doe you once attempt to prove. It is like you did perceive the worke would be too hard for you, and therefore, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your tergiverſing humor, you ſet your ſelf onely to ſtudie ſhifts, and evaſions, whereof this <hi>Objection</hi> is the firſt, to decline your duty. But from this your firſt ſubterfuge, you may eaſily be beaten, by this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> For either Scripture is perſpicuous in all things neceſſary, or not. If you ſay not, then why doe you not bring arguments to diſprove its perſpicuity, you being the <hi>Opponent?</hi> If you grant that it is perſpicuous, then why may it not be a ground, to diſtinguiſh a True Religion from a falſe? Even as a clear luculent Charter, or Patent under the great ſeal, may be a ground, to juſtifie the title of an honeſt <hi>Sempronius,</hi> againſt the pretences of a cavilling <hi>Titius.</hi> Nor can it be matter of ſuch impoſſibilitie, for PROTESTANTS (as you falſlie inſinuate,) to find out the true ſenſe of Scripture, if Scripture be perſpicuous. May you not then ſee, what worke is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent to you, if you deſire to have the matter in controverſie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſed? Namely, either to prove, <hi>That Scripture is not perspicuous in all things neceſſary,</hi> or elſe, <hi>That the Religion of</hi> PROTESTANTS, <hi>is not agreeable to that true, and perſpicuous ſenſe of Scripture</hi> And ſeeing you may as eaſily prove light to be darkeneſſe, as diſprove the perſpicuity of the Scriptures, in all things neceſſary to Salvation, you may try your <hi>Acumen,</hi> upon the conſonancy of our Religion, with the true and genuine ſenſe of Scripture. Pitch therefore upon the chiefe points in controverſie, betwixt you and us, ſuch as your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Infallibilitie, The headſhip of your Pope,</hi> your <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſſe,</hi> and let it be tryed, whether they be agreeable to the genuine ſenſe of Scripture. I ſhall be willing, to heat, and to examine, what you have to ſay for them, and withall, Godwilling, I ſhall not be wanting, to repone to you, arguments, to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101081:63"/>prove them to be impious errors, and diſſonant or the perſpicuous, and genuine ſenſe of Scripture. Then may you beſt diſcerne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we PROTESTANTS, can hold forth the true ſenſe of Scripture. But your whole deſigne appears, to be, to ſhift a Scripturall tryall. And this is generally obſerved now, to be the way of your late <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleters,</hi> and herein you reſemble the old <hi>Hereticks,</hi> of whome ſaid <hi>Tertullian. Lib.

The truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and its conſonancy with the genuine ſenſe of Scripture, hath been ſo often and ſo luculendy ſhewed, by the Champions of the <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> cauſe, that for me to adde any thing thereto, were but to bring a torch to give light to the Sun. All that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of me, according to the <hi>Rules of diſputing,</hi> is to clear off any cavils, which you bring againſt the conſonancy of our Religion, with the true ſenſe of Scripture. Yet will you come to the examination
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101081:64"/>of particular points in controverſie, you ſhall perhaps find, that I ſhall not only doe the part of a <hi>Defendant.</hi> In the mean time, is it not a ſtrong preſumption, that the truth ſhines brightly on our fide, ſeeing after all your inſolent boaſtings, and ſo many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie appeales from us, you can bring no poſitive argument, either againſt the Scriptures perſpicuity, or the conſonancie of our Religion, with the genuine ſenſe of Scripture, but only betake your ſelf to your flieing ſhifts &amp; declinaturs, &amp; this for your firſt <hi>objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye object Secondly, <hi>That before I affirme ſo boldly, that all things neceſſary are contained in Scripture, I ſhould firſt have drawne up a Liſt, and Catalogue of theſe neceſſary truths, whereas Scripture</hi> (ſay you,) <hi>makes no diſtinction, betwixt theſe neceſſarie truths and others.</hi> And now you would be making uſe of an old example of mine, <hi>That there is no way to prove a piece of Gold to be upright, but by producing it to be examined.</hi> To which I repon. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that by this your objection againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being a ſufficient <hi>Canon,</hi> as containing all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to Salvation, you contradict your own ſelf.

And here by the way, I might let you ſee,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101081:65"/>what a fool you wer in medling with my example, <hi>Of trying pieces of gold ſeverally by the Tonchſtone.</hi> For in the preſent caſe, it can import no more, but, that before any truth be concluded neceſſarie, it muſt firſt be found, that the Scriptures hath put a character of neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and conſequently, all neceſſarie truths muſt be contained in Scripture, <hi>Quod erat demonſtrandum.</hi> You would therefore not medle with my weapons, leſt they cut your hands. But <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and laſtly, I adde, that you <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> are as much concerned, to draw up a liſt and catalogue of neceſſaries as we, and I am ſure in ſo doing, you ſhall find greater difficulty, eſpecially, if with your late Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, you ſay, that all that, and onely that, is neceſſarie, which your <hi>Church</hi> hath defined. For firſt, can ye agree among your ſelves, to tell me, what you mean by the Church? Or ſecondly, can you enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merat a preciſe catalogue, of all that the Church hath defined? Or how can you aſcertaine any of the true ſenſe of theſe <hi>Definitions?</hi> Or Thirdly, can you ſhow me, who hath impowered the Church, ſince the dayes of the Apoſtles to put a <hi>Character of neceſſity</hi> to Salvation, upon a truth, which had it not before? And Fourthly, did not I from this demonſtrate, your Religion to be a falſe Religion, becauſe, it differs in its eſſentials, and in theſe things, which to you are neceſſary to Salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from the faith of the moſt ancient &amp; primitive Church? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>Formula fidei</hi> contrived by <hi>Pope Pius the fourth,</hi> hath made all the canons of the councill of <hi>Trent</hi> neceſſarie, which I am ſure, neither you, nor any man, ſhall be able to ſhow, to have been the faith of the moſt Ancient and primitive Church. Though this hath been put to you once and againe, yet have you not dared to touch upon this ſtring. Yea <hi>Fifthly,</hi> from this your impoſing new neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, (whereas, <hi>Regula fidei,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well ſayed, <hi>Lib. de velandis Virgin: Una omnino eſt immobilis &amp; irrefomabilis,</hi>) many of our Divines, have demonſtrated your <hi>Church</hi> to be the moſt <hi>Schiſmaticall ſociety,</hi> that bears the name of a Church under Heaven. For by this, you have cut your ſelves off, both from the ancient Church, and from the greateſt part of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> at this day. Among many others who have convicted you of this greivous crime, you may try,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101081:66"/>how you can expede your ſelf, from that which hath been ſaid to this purpoſe, by <hi>Decter Morton,</hi> in his booke, intituled, <hi>The Grand Impoſture of the Church of Rome, cap.</hi> 15. by <hi>Stilling fleet, in his Vindicatione of the Biſhop of Canterbury, part,</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. And <hi>Voetius,</hi> in his <hi>Deſperata cauſa Papatus, lib.</hi> 3. From this it were eaſy to demonſtrat, that notwithſtanding your great pretences to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiciſme,</hi> we, &amp; not ye, are the true <hi>Catholiks.</hi> For we acknowledge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with the whole Church both ancient &amp; modern, which keep the eſſentials &amp; fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tals of Chriſtianity. But your Chuch by impoſing new neceſſary articles of faith, which neither the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, nor yet the greateſt part of the preſent Church, did ever acknowledge, have cut your ſelves off from the body. I ſhall cloſe this <hi>Section</hi> with this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either the Scriptures doe containe all that is neceſſarie to Salvation, or not; if they doe, then you are a perverſe wrangling ſophiſter, in cavilling againſt this truth. If not, then inſtance one neceſſary truth not contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scriptures. And this ſhould have been, your worke, if you would have done any thing to purpoſe, againſt this precious truth, of the Scriptures, being a compleet <hi>Canon;</hi> to have ſhowed ſome <hi>Neceſſary article</hi> of faith not contained therein. And if you ſet to this worke, remember, that according to your own principles, you muſt prove it by ſome infallible authority, which you will find as hard a worke, as to roll <hi>Syſiphi Saxum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In place of your third objection, you enquire, <hi>What are the means for interpreting Scripture? what is the due uſe of theſe means? Whether a falſe Religion may not uſe the meane? And whether people without preaching, can duely uſe the means of interpretation, and come to the knowledge of all things neceſſary?</hi> And from the uſe of meane of interpretation, you would conclude the Scriptures not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. Behold now of a diſputant, you are become a <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist.</hi> You have need I confeſſe in your old dayes, to turne a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen,</hi> and if you would become a docile Diſciple, you might receive convincing inſtructions, and find that you had no juſt cauſe, to have turned a <hi>Runnagade,</hi> from the Religion of PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101081:66"/>unto which you were baptized. But ſo long, as your <hi>Queries</hi> proceed from a cavilling humor, you deſerve no other anſwere, then the retortion of ſome puzling Queries, as our Lord Chriſt, ſometimes confuted the inſidious interrogaturs of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, A remarkeable inſtance whereof you may find, <hi>Luke,</hi> 20. from verſe 2. to verſe 8, And therefore, to pull down theſe Spider webs, in which you ſeeme not a little to confide, know <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the uſe of means of interpretation, doth nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogat from the aſſerted <hi>Perſpicuity</hi> of the Scriptures; eſpecially, ſeeing the principall means of interpretation, are to be fetched from the Scripture it ſelf.

And therefore, to cut off that cavill, I purpofly added that caution, of <hi>Uſing the means of interpretation;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit on the other hand, you would abuſe this conceſſion, to derogat from the Scriptures perſpicuty, but with equal ingenuity with your <hi>Cardinal. Fourthly,</hi> Whereas you ask, <hi>Whether the people without preaching, can duely uſe the means of interpretation, and come to the knowledge of things neceſſary to Salvation?</hi> A ludibrious queſtion as proponed by you implying, as would ſeeme, a clear <hi>Contradiction</hi> in it ſelf. For preaching is one of theſe means of interpretation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is all one, as if you had asked, whether people may at once uſe all the means, and yet not uſe ſome of them? Is it not a manifeſt <hi>Contradiction</hi> to uſe them all, and not to uſe them all at once? But to take of all miſtakes, we ſay, that attendance on publick preaching, is one meane to which people are tyed <hi>Neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> when they may have it, which is clearly confirmed by theſe Scriptures, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Deſpiſe not Propheſieing.

But <hi>Fifthly,</hi> there yet temaines one of your judicious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, namely, <hi>Whether a falſe Religion may duely uſe the means of interpretation?</hi> I think you would have asked, whether people profeſſing a falſe Religion, may uſe duely the means, for it is a verie incongruous ſpeach, to ſay, <hi>That Religion uſeth means.</hi> But paſſing that incongruicy, I anſwere breifly, that people profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a falſe Religion, are bound <hi>De jure,</hi> to uſe the means duely, though <hi>De facto,</hi> they doe not uſe them duely, ſo long as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heare to <hi>A falſe Religion.</hi> For as I ſaid, from the beginning of this debate, there is ſuch an <hi>Objective evidence</hi> in Scripture truths, that if they be not perceived, when ſufficiently propoſed, it is ſtill through ſome defect on the part of the ſubject: As doth luculent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeare, from 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is to them, in whome the God of this world hath blinded their minds. And, Joh.</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man doe the will of GOD, he ſhall know the Doctrine, whether it be of GOD.</hi> This far have I condeſcended, to ſatisfie your <hi>Extravagant Queriet,</hi> and I hope, have ſufficiently vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from all your cavills, this <hi>First ground</hi> of the true Religion, taken from <hi>The Perspicuity and Perfection of the Scriptures.</hi> But doe not expect hereaftere, to meet with the like indulgence, as if I would take notice of your <hi>'Digreſſive questions,</hi> when you neither obſerve rules of diſputing, nor keep cloſe to the maine hing of the controverſie.</p>
               <p>I cannot here, but put you in minde againe of another ground which I propoſed in my laſt two Papers, from which the truth of our Religion may be demonſtrated, namely, <hi>The conformity thereof in all its eſſentials, with the faith of the moſt Ancient Church, in the firſt three Centuries.</hi> This you ſtill diſſemble, as if you were deafe on that eare. Onely in the cloſe of one of your obſervations, concerning the perſpicuitie of the Scripture, to confuſe theſe two grounds together, (that ſo you might eſcape in the darke, and that your tergiverſation, and not ſpeaking to this ground diſtinctly, might be the leſſe obſervable,) you doe impertinently
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101081:68"/>throw in this word. <hi>That the claims to antiquity is common to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſexts.</hi> I beleeve, you would have ſaid, <hi>Sects.</hi> But beſides what hath been ſaid in my former Papers, to redargue ſuch a trifling Reply, now I adde, that the falſhood of the claime of the other <hi>Sects,</hi> may be evicted, by holding out the diſcrepancy, betwixt the faith of the ancient Church, and falſe Religions. As I proved the falſhood of your <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, from the diſſonancy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your now <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, or <hi>Formula fidei</hi> of <hi>Pope Pius the fourth</hi> and the faith of the ancient Church in theſe ages; which as yet, you have not once endeavoured to anſwere, though now it be the third time put to you. If you had intended to ſay any thing to purpoſe, againſt us PROTESTANTS, to this particular, you ſhould have inſtanced <hi>Some eſſentials</hi> of the Chriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ancient Church did differ from us. But I find, that the chief facultio of your <hi>Romiſh Champions,</hi> lyes in braging, and falſe accuſing. How often have they accuſed PROTESTANTS, as Innovatours? And who are ſuch pretenders to antiquity as they? But it is a true character, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> gave long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, of our and your writers, <hi>Non ſumus nos novatores, ſed vos estis veteratores.</hi> And therefore to vindicate the truth which we mantaine, from all their reproaches, I have offered, to diſpute the cauſe of Religion, betwixt us and you, both from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> But you doe ſhift the tryall, from both theſe grounds, as much as a Theif would ſhift to be examined by a <hi>Iurie.</hi> You are therefore againe required, to anſwere my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>From the diſerepancy betwixt your now Romiſh Creed, and the faith of the Ancient Church,</hi> And to inſtance, if you can, <hi>One difference in eſſentialls, betwixt the faith of the Ancient Church and our Religion;</hi> elſe it muſt be held for confeſſed, that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which you ſo much reproach, is, <hi>The truely Ancient Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Religion,</hi> and yours, but the tares which the envyous one, did latly ſow in the Lords field, and that your pretence to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is no better, then the <hi>Gibeonits</hi> mouldie bread, <hi>Ieſ.</hi> 9.5.12.</p>
               <p>Towards the <hi>Coneluſion,</hi> you are ſo diſcreet, as to upbraid me,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101081:69"/>as <hi>Altogether ignorant of the nature of ſupernatural faith.</hi> Becauſe foreſooth, I would not acknowledge, <hi>That the aſſent of faith, which is given to articles of Religion, muſt be founded, upon the foreknowledge of the infallible aſſiſtance, of the propounders thereof,</hi> I ſuppoſe you meane the <hi>Clergie,</hi> of whome you ſpake in your former Papers. But <hi>First,</hi> were you not concemed, (if you had looked to your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) before you had taken the boldneſſe, to reproach me for <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in this matter, firſt to have cleared your ſelf from theſe <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi> wherein I have demonſtrated you to be involved, from your former aſſertions, concerning <hi>This infallible aſſiſtance of the Clergie? Secondly,</hi> were you ſo ſhallow, as not to diſcerne, that you intangle your ſelf in a <hi>New contradiction,</hi> by this your preſent diſcourſe? For if everie ſupernatura aſſent of faith to a divine truth, muſt be founded, upon <hi>The foreknowledge of the infallible aſſiſtance</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder thereof, then the firſt aſſent to <hi>The neceſſity of the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this aſſiſtance in the Propounder,</hi> muſt preſuppoſe it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to you, <hi>An Act of ſupernatural faith:</hi> And yet it cannot preſuppoſe it, becauſe it is the firſt aſſent which the perſon hath concerning that aſſiſtance: And conſequently, if it did preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a former knowledge of that aſſiſtance, it ſhould be firſt, and not firſt. Is not this a goodly <hi>Religion</hi> which you have, that you cannot move one ſtep in mantainance thereof, without intangling your ſelf ſtill in contradictions? But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> either <hi>This neceſſity of the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the infallible aſſiſtance, of the propounder of divine truths,</hi> which you make the foundation, of all ſupernatural faith, can be proven or not. If not, then all your faith is founded upon a fancie, which cannot be proven. If it can be proven, why ſhunne you to doe it, I haveing ſo often required it of you? But now I will lay this <hi>Dilemma</hi> about you. If it can be proven, either it muſt be from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or from ſome <hi>Unwriten Word,</hi> to uſe your <hi>Romaniſts</hi> phraſe. Not from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> for according to you, no ſenſe of Scripture can be known, unles firſt the <hi>Infallible aſſiſtance of the propounder thereof be known,</hi> and therefore, when one doubts of the infallible aſſiſtance of the proponer, it is impoſſible, according to your principles, that this can be proven
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101081:69"/>from <hi>Scripture.</hi> Nor can you prove it by any <hi>Unwriten Word.</hi> For you have aſſerted in your former Papers, that a point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>To be true, and to be conforme to the Writen Word of GOD, are Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenima's,</hi> and that the one of theſe, cannot be proven before the other. Therefore, you cannot prove the truth of this point, conceming the Clergies aſſiſtance, meerly by an unwriten Word, elſe it ſhould be known to be true, before its conformity to the writen Word were known, which is the <hi>Contradictorie</hi> of your former aſſertion. But beſides, to know the ſenſe of a <hi>Decretal, Canon of Councill, or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> or what ever elſe you will runne to, as diſtinct from the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of GOD, there is as great neceſſitie of <hi>The foreknowledge, of the aſſiſtance of the propounder thereof,</hi> as for the knowing of the true ſenſe of Scripture. And therefore, before I aſſent to the true ſenſe of a <hi>Decretal, Canon of Councill, or Tradition by a ſupernatural Act of faith,</hi> I muſt firſt know, that the propounder is guided by an infallible aſſiſtance, and conſequently, when one doubts of this infallible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the propounder, neither can it be proven by anie <hi>Vnwriten word, Decretal, Canon of Councill, or Tradition.</hi> Expede your ſelf from this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> if you can, without deſtroying your own principles, by which you are locked up in <hi>Contradictions.</hi> Nay more, I here freely offer, will you, or any prove to me, either <hi>From Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Tradition, That the foreknowledge, of ſuch infallible aſſistance of your Clergie, is a neceſſarie prerequiſite before I can give a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aſſent of faith to an article of Religion,</hi> and I will turne <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt.</hi> Can I make a fairer proffer to you? Will you not have ſo much compaſſion upon me, as to make me your Proſelyte? But I may divine here, and not be a Propher, you will as ſcone remove the Earth out of its place, according to <hi>Archimedes</hi> bold undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to prove your <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> from either of theſe forementioned grounds. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> when you talke ſo liberally of this <hi>Aſſiſtance of the Propounder, of articles of faith,</hi> ought you not to determine, whome you meane by <hi>This Propounder?</hi> I hope you extend it not to all the people, nay, nor to all who have received <hi>Orders.</hi> It was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If you cannot agree among your ſelves, who this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Propounder is,</hi> doe you not reel as to the <hi>Foundation of your faith?</hi> I therefore require you againe to determine to me, if you can, <hi>An Infallible Propounder of articles of faith,</hi> agreed upon by you <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and to produce the evidences for this infallibity from <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Vniverſal Tradition,</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>general Council.</hi> You would make the world beleeve, that you had an infallible Propounder of divine truths, and yet you cannot agree who he is.

               <p>Know therefore <hi>Eightly,</hi> that the aſſent which we give to divine truths, <hi>Is truely ſupernatural.</hi> I ſhall not blot Paper at the time, with the aiery debats of your <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> concerning the nature of a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural being.</hi> They who would recreat themſelves with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, may ſee enough of theſe needle headed nyceties, <hi>In Ripalda de Ente ſupernaturali, in Arriag.</hi> 1. <hi>part.

Now, whether there be no more to be ſaid, for the <hi>Supernaturality</hi> of our aſſent, which is founded, on the authority of <hi>Divine Scriptural teſtimony,</hi> then for yours, which is onely founded upon the authority of your <hi>Propounders,</hi> that is, a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> (for theſe are your immediat Propounders,) or at beſt, a <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Councill,</hi> whoſe <hi>Infallibility</hi> you can never prove, and concerning whoſe ſenſe, you may fluctuat till you die, whether I ſay, there be not more to be ſaid, for the <hi>Supernaturality</hi> of our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then for yours, let theſe who are rational Judge? But <hi>Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> may cut off all ground of cavilling, whereas you propound the queſtion thus, <hi>Whether a man can beleeve a thing to be true preciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe it is revealed and ſpoken by GOD, unleſſe he be aſſured, that GOD speakes by the month of him that proponed ſuch a thing?</hi> I <hi>Anſwere</hi> to both the branches of your queſtion diſtinctly. And to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, that if by <hi>Preciſtie,</hi> you meane a ſecluſion of the <hi>Means of interpretation,</hi> (for the queſtion at preſent is of the ſenſe of Scripture,) or a ſecluſion of extrinſick motives of credibility, you may know that we PROTESTANTS, mantaine no ſuch Secluſion. But if you meane the ſecluſion onely, of any <hi>Vlterior formal object,</hi> into which the aſſent of faith is to be reſolved, then indeed we man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the authority of divine teſtimony, is the <hi>Vltimat formal object,</hi> into which, our aſſent of faith is to be reſolved. And this ſeemes clear from the nature of <hi>Divine faith,</hi> which in this, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101081:71"/>from the aſſent of <hi>Humane faith,</hi> or purely <hi>Sciential.</hi> That <hi>Humane faith,</hi> is built upon the authority of an <hi>Humane testimony,</hi> and a <hi>Sciential aſſent</hi> on the <hi>Principles of reaſon;</hi> but <hi>Divine faith,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the authority of <hi>Divine teſtimony.</hi> Should we therefore in the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of <hi>Faith,</hi> proceed to an <hi>Ulterior formal object;</hi> It would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceaſe to be a <hi>Divine faith,</hi> or elſe we ſhould onely proceed, from one <hi>Divine teſtimony</hi> to another: And ſo, we muſt either runne <hi>In infinitum,</hi> from one to another, or elſe, reſt in ſome laſt; and then, why not rather in the firſt <hi>Scriptural testimony,</hi> which by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of all, is <hi>Divine?</hi> Whereas the divine authoritie, of all your other teſtimonies, are juſtly queſtioned, and will never by you be ſolidlie proven, except in ſo far, as they ſpeake conſonantlie to the Scripture. To the ſecond branch of your queſtion, <hi>I Anſwere</hi> thus. If your meaning be, that the aſſurance of the <hi>Clergies</hi> aſſiſtance, <hi>In actu primo,</hi> to propound nothing but truth, be a neceſſarie prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſire, then I ſimply deny it, and often, (though in vaine,) have required you to prove it. Nay, I have demonſtrated you to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in <hi>Contradictions,</hi> by aſſerting it. And if yet you will man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch a thing, I ſhall but demand of you, whereon that aſſurance of the <hi>Clergie</hi> or propounders aſſiſtance, is founded; Wherein I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, you ſhall never be able to ſatisfie your ſelf, nor any rational perſon. But if you meane no more but that, when we give an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of faith</hi> to an article of Religion, propounded by another, we muſt alſo, <hi>Simul &amp; ſemel,</hi> aſſent, that the teſtimonie which he hath given thereto is true: This is indeed granted. But from this it doth not follow, that the <hi>Previous aſſurance of the propounders infallibilty, is the ground of my aſſent.</hi> Even as, when a <hi>Mathematician,</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats a propoſition of <hi>Enclide,</hi> the ſciential aſſent of the Hearer, is not founded upon the authoritie of the <hi>Mathematician,</hi> but upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>Premiſſes,</hi> from which he deduceth his <hi>Concluſion:</hi> Albeit the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> propounding the premiſſes, was a meane to draw forth the hearers aſſent, and in aſſenting to the demonſtration, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to the <hi>Mathematicians</hi> diſcourſe as true.

                  <hi>Municipal Law,</hi> given by a civil Iudge, though he had no previous aſſurance of his <hi>Infallibility;</hi> which example you ſtrive to elude, ſaying, <hi>That aſſent was not ſupreame.</hi> But I deſire to know, what you meane by a <hi>Supreame aſſent?</hi> If you meane a <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural aſſent,</hi> I acknowlege it is not <hi>Supernatural;</hi> neither did I compare the aſſent which we give, to the ſenſe of a <hi>Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Law.</hi> and the aſſent of <hi>Divine faith</hi> in that regard. But if you meane, that it is not a <hi>Firme</hi> and <hi>Certaine</hi> aſſent, but fluctuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doubting; then you ſpeake falſlie, and are confuted by mens daylie experience. And herein onely made I the parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two aſſents: That as we may give a firme and certaine aſſent, <hi>Ordinis naturalis,</hi> to the ſenſe of a <hi>Municipal Law,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by a Civil Iudge, without a <hi>Previous aſſurance, ordinis naturalis,</hi> of the judges <hi>Infallibility;</hi> ſo why may we not aſſent, by a <hi>Supernatural Act of faith</hi> to divine truths, propounded by a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> though we have not an <hi>Antecedent ſupernatural aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his infallibility, in actu primo?</hi> And it is a groſſe miſtake in you, to ſay, <hi>That the aſſent which we give, to the ſenſe given by a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Iudge, is founded on his abilities, and therefore, that the degrees of our certainly is correspondent to the Stronger, or Weaker perſuaſions, that we have of his ability.</hi> I ſay, this is a groſſe miſtake, for ſometime an able Iudge may give a wrong ſenſe of the Law, and a weaker Iudge the right ſenſe, and the hearer, conſidering the evidence, which the wecker brings for his ſenſe, may give a firme aſſent to the ſenſe propounded by the weaker Iudge. Even ſo, a weaker Divine, like a <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> may give at a time the true ſenſe of Scripture, when abler <hi>Doctors</hi> may give a wrong ſenſe, and the hearer may upon good ground, ſubſcrive to the ſenſe given by the weaker.

               <p>I Received your ſixth Paper of the ninth of Auguſt, containing a maſſe and heap of digreſſions, copied out of controverſy bookes, of miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101081:73"/>phraſes, of groſſe miſtakeings, and of injurious and railing words, where you are pleaſed to honour me with thir Titles, <hi>Vir nequam,</hi> a ſycophant, an effronted calumniator, a man of a proſtitute reputation, a fool, &amp;c. You have been often defired, and are now deſired againe, to give a proofe of your valour, and to ſhow, that you are able to put ten onely lines in Paper to the purpoſe; obſerving three things, which every one will judge to be rationally demanded of you. Firſt, That you lay aſide all Digreſſions, that is to ſay, that you omit all theſe things, without nameing of the which, the preſent controverſie may be fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. Secondly, That you omit all baſe and hiſtrionical expreſſions, and contumelious words. Thirdly, That you omit all theſe things which cannot ſerve to prove the truth of your Religion; but with this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that it is equallie applyable to prove a falſe Religion to be true. But ſince this reaſonable favour cannot be obtained of you, you wil give me leave, as I have often proteſted, and proteſts of new, that I wil take no notice, but cloſe misken all that is out of the way, and out of this our firſt line.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion cannot be the true Religion, nor the Religion, to the which GOD hath annexed the promiſes of ſupernatural happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and conſcquentlie, whoſoever aimes at eternal happineſſe after this life, or intends to ſave his Soul, is obliged in conſcience to quit it, and to betake himſelf to a diligent ſearch, where the True Religion is to be found, preſcinding for now, where it is to be found, and inſiſting meerlie in this, that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion cannot be it. This is proven by this one Syllogiſme.</p>
               <p>
                  <list>
                     <item>That Religion cannot be the True Religion, which hath no ſpecial ground or principle, whereby it can be proven to be a True Religion, or to be a Religion, conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD.</item>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:101081:74"/>
                     <item>But the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion hath no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ground or principle, whereby it can be proven to be a True Religion, or a Religion conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD.</item>
                     <item>Ergo, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion cannot be a True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>You denying here the <hi>Subſumption,</hi> were advertiſed of this one thing, that a true principle or ground is not an indifferent nature, but is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially determined to prove and infer onely truth, and ſo, not to produce any thing for a principle or ground, to prove the truth of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Religion, which may ſerve with as great reaſon to prove a falſe Religion to be true.</p>
               <p>After much fluctuation, and many ſhifting toes and froes, at lentgh you have pitched on two things, which you ſay you will mantaine as ſolid grounds, to prove the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion to be true, and to be diſtinguiſhed from all falſe Religions. The firſt is, <hi>The perſpcuity of Scripture, in all points neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> But it was ſhowne you, the great jugling that lyes under this anſwere. For first, by Scriptur of which is affirmed, that it contains perspicuouſly all things neceſſary to Salvation, muſt be underſtood, the true letter, and the true ſenſe of the true letter of Scripture. Ergo, it cannot ſerve for a ground to prove the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, to be a true Religion, except it be firſt proven, that the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> hath both the true letter and <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> and likewiſe the true ſenſe of the letter. To this, in which the maine point conſiſts, you give no anſwere, nor brings no proofe, but onely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits me to read your <hi>Proteſtant Authors,</hi> whome you call Champions, and who, as you ſay, have made all thir things clear as the Sun. But wherefore doe you not produce the reaſons of theſe your Champions, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101081:74"/>they may be examined and impugued?</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was asked, how you could ſo boldly affirme, that all things neceſſar to Salvation, or rather that all the tenets, which the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion holds as neceſſary to Salvation, were contained clearly in Scripture, except firſt, <hi>Drawing op a catalogue of all things that the Proteſtant Religion holds, as points neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> and as contradiſtinguiſhed from all other things not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. To this you anſwere now, that a Propoſition in generall may be beleeved, though the beleever cannot make an induction of all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars contained in it. So we beleeve, that all the dead ſhall riſe, though we cannot give a particular account of their perſons. But it ſeems this anſwere hath eſcaped your penne, when you were thinking on other things. For though I beleeve a propoſition in generall, when that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is revealed in generall. But where is it revealed, that all the tenets that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion holds, for points noceſſar to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are clearly in Scripture? For, giving and not granting, that this generall propoſition, All things neceſſar to Salvation are clearly ſet down in Scripture, were revealed by Scripture it ſelf atteſting it; yet it doeth not follow, that this other generall propoſition is revealled, All the tenets that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion holds, as neceſſar to Salvation, are clearly contained in Scripture: or that they may be clearly deduced out of things, clearly ſet down in Scripture. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it cannot be an object of divine faith, but by deduceing it by <hi>Induction</hi> of particulars. And to this ſerves your own example of a purſe full of an hundred pieces of Gold; for though I may beleeve in general, that all the gold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that purſe is upright gold, if this were revealed in general by a ſufficient authority, yet preſcinding from all authority, affirmeing this, I cannot aſſent, that they are all, and none excepted upright gold, except taking them all one by one, and putting them to the tryall, becauſe, if only one of them were not upright, the whole aſſent would be falſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though you ſay all things neceſſar to Salvation, to be clearly ſet down in Scripture, yet you require the due uſe of certaine middes to attaine to the true knowledge of thir things, and being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to specifie thir middes, and what you meane by the due uſe of them? And for anſwere to this, you bring now onely a long Digreſſion, about
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101081:75"/>rules to interpret Scripture, ſlightin the maine print, which is to ſhow in this, a difference betwixt you, and theſe of a falſe Religion, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe of a falſe Religion, may not uſe as duely theſe middes, as you can doe, for attaining to the true ſenſe of Scripture. To this you onely anſwere, that <hi>De facto,</hi> they doe not uſe duely theſe middes, and, <hi>That the God of this world hath blinded their minds, &amp;c.</hi> But what if they apply this to your ſelf?</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground that you have pitched upon, to prove the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Religion to be a true Religion, and to be diſtinguiſhed from all falſe Religion, <hi>Is the conformity it hath with the doctrine of the firſt three Centuries.</hi> But this cannot be a ground, diſtinct from the conformity which you ſay your Religion hath, with the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture. Becauſe giving and not granting, that your doctrine had this conformity, you cannot by this prove, that it is a true doctrine, ſince by you <hi>All theſe were fallible,</hi> and might have erred; And conformity with doctrine, that may be error, cannot ſerve to prove a doctrine to be true. And if you reply, that though they were fallible and might erre, yet they did not erre becauſe the doctrine they gave, is conforme to the true, ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the conformity with them, is not a ground distinct from the conformity with the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture. Or elſe you might prove the conformity, with the Acts of Parliament, in matters of Religion, to be a ground to prove the truth of your Religion, and a diſtinct ground, from the conformity which theſe Acts hath with the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture. <hi>Ergo,</hi> to make good, that the conformity of your Religion, with the doctrine of the Church in the firſt three centuries, is a diſtinct ground, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, you muſt give ſome <hi>Authoritie</hi> to the <hi>Fathers</hi> who were then, whereby they were preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from error, though of themſelves they were fallible. And this muſt conſiſt, either in ſome intrinſecal quality inherent in them, or in ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial extrinſecal aſſistance, founded on <hi>Chriſts promite.</hi> And here you have likewiſe to prove, that this intri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101081:75"/>none afterwards. Wherein I expect likewiſe ſome <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> out of your mouth; to wit, that Chriſt diſpenſes the protection promiſed to his Church, that manner of way that natural Agents doth dispenſe their activity, within a certaine Sphere, <hi>Uniformiter, Difformiter,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceing more in parts near, and leſſe in the parts more remote. But ſince Chriſt hath promiſed to be with <hi>His Church to the end of the world, and that the portes of hell ſhall not prevail againſt her,</hi> then the dogmes and doctrine of the Church, in the fifteenth Centurie when <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> leap out, were as pure, and as free from all error, as they were in the firſt three Centuries, and the one may be called as-much in queſtion, as the other, ſince both are equally founded upon Chriſts promiſe, haveing no ſhorter Sphere and terme, then the end of the world.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit by the way, to marr and diſturb a little the compleſance, and contentment that you ſeeme to take, in dealing with your own ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, fancying <hi>Contradictions</hi> upon my part, which are all founded u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon your miſapprehendings, miſtakeing one thing for another. For you ſuppone, that the knowledge of the ability and aſſiſtance in him, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pones matters to be beleeved, becauſe it is prerequired to all Acts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith, that therefore it is in it ſelf, an <hi>Object of divine faith,</hi> and ſo you confound the <hi>Evident aſſent, and judgement of credibilitie,</hi> with the <hi>Obſcure Act of faith,</hi> and the motive of the one, with the motive of the other. For though the Act, or aſſent of divine faith, cannot be had, except this other preceed, yet faith existent, hath its own proper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal motive, diſtinct from the motive of that other Act, and judgement prerequired to it. As likewiſe out of the fear of hel, a Sinner may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to make an act of <hi>Contrition,</hi> for his ſinnes, though his act of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi> exiſtent, have no wayes for the motive of it, the paines of hel. Another contradiction you fancie to your ſelf, founded upon another ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant mistakeing, as if I had ſaid, that a point of Religion to be true, and to be conforme to Scripture, were two <hi>Synonims:</hi> Since this was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, <hi>Ad Hominem,</hi> and to oppugne you out of your own principles, who holds that nothing can be a point of faith, but that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, or in the writen word of God, and ſo in this you doe,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:101081:76"/>as other of your Champions hath done, citeing for the aſſertions of ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticks and fathers objections that they make against themſelves.</p>
               <p>Out of this appears, how true it is that was told you that you ſhow your ſelf <hi>Altogether ignorant,</hi> of the nature of divine and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faith, ſince that out of this, that faith hath for the formal motive of it, onely GODS word and revelation, you infer, that it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and exiſt, though there not preceed a knowledge, that GOD ſpeaks by the mouth of the Propounder. Yea, in this you ſhow your ſelf alſo altogether ignorant, of the nature of our intellect, and underſtanding, who as it cannot but aſſent, when the object propounded is in it ſelf evident, ſo it cannot aſſent by faith whether divine or humane, except it know the authority of him that ſpeakes, or propones; and according as the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er knowes him that ſpeakes, to be of leſſe or more authority, he adheres with more or leſſe firmnes, to the thing that is spoken, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, our intellect might aſſent to a thing, though there were nothing to induce him, ſince here, there interveins nothing, to induce one to beleeve, but onely the authority of the speaker. And what makes it to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the inſtance which you bring againſt this, to wit, <hi>That ſometimes a more skilful Iudge, and Doctor, may give a wrong ſenſe of a Law, and a weaker may give the true ſenſe?</hi> Since it may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that an <hi>Old Wife</hi> give the true ſenſe of a text of Scripture, and you, though both a Miniſter, and a Teacher of Divinity, give a falſe ſenſe And yet it doth not follow, but the underſtanding of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be inclined more to adhere, and aſſent to your ſenſe, though falſe, then to hers though true, ſupponing that there interveene no other thing to move, ſave onely your authority and hers: Becauſe, that which induces immediatly the underſtanding to aſſent, is not the objective truths of things in themſelves, but onely, as they appeare; according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that oftentimes falſe things are more likely then true.</p>
               <p>You can never end one of your Papers without ſome bragging, and you end this, perſuading your ſelf, that your Papers containes ſuch pregnant and convincing reaſons againſt Popery, that if they were reviſed by impartial Iudges, they would turne backe to you againe with this ſuperſcription, <hi>Deſperata cauſa papatus.</hi> But this muſt be beleeved,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101081:76"/>becauſe you ſay it, and you your ſelf muſt be of a ſweet temper, who can ſolace your ſelf with ſuch dreams.</p>

               <p>In my firſt three Papers, I required you, to prove the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of your Syllogiſme.

Hereupon I might have turned my back upon you, as a ſmattering fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, wholly incapable to mantaine a Theological debate. But to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you the more inexcuſable, and to convince all, to whoſe hands theſe Papers may come, how deſirous I was to have the truth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, I condeſcended <hi>Ex ſuperabundanti,</hi> (though not tyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Yet have you the impudencie in this your <hi>Seventh Paper, to ſay, that after many toes and froes, now I have produced two grounds;</hi> as if either I had delivered ſome inconſiſtencies, or had been driven to produce theſe grounds, by force of your arguments, or that now only in my laſt Paper, theſe grounds had been firſt produced: All which are maniſeſt untruths.

               </p>
               <p>The two grounds which I produced, I did prove in my <hi>Fourth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> to be ſolid, and ſufficiently diſtinctive of the true Religion, from a falſe, and from them, I did demonſtrate the truth of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the falſhood of yours, (for, <hi>Rectum eſt ſui &amp; obliqui In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi>) but you have not once dared to examine theſe arguments.

I required you, with the like plainneſs, to ſet down the judgement of your <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> and the rather, becauſe your Authors are found to be inconſiſtent with one another, in this matter. And though I have looked upon your ableſt Controverſiſts, namelie. <hi>Bellarmin, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De verbo Dei, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Gretſer, In defenſione ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitis primi libri tertii Bellarmin.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101081:79"/>and tranſlation,</hi> of Scripture. Prove, if you can, that we are either deſtitute of the true letter, tranſlation or ſenſe of the Scripture. What I ſaid of PROTESTANT <hi>Writers,</hi> that they have ſhewed our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to be conforme to the true ſenſe of Scripture, (which indeed they have done, as with a Sun beame,) was not, that they in that had performed, what now I was tyed to doe, but as then I told you, that it were no impoſſible taske, but had often been performed, though at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I reſolved to keep you to the <hi>Rules</hi> of argueing. Yea, did I not deal more liberally with you, and require you, to pitch on ſome chief points in controverſie, betwixt you and us, and for your encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, promiſed, that I ſhould not onely hold the <hi>Defendants</hi> part? But you cannot be drawne out of your lurkeing holes, and thereby you diſcover both your deſperat cauſe, and cowardly Spirit. Nay more, have I not in my laſt Paper, proven ſundrie points of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie againſt you? Such as the <hi>Perfection of Scripture, the perspicuity of Scripture, the falliblity both of Popes, and Councils, &amp;c.</hi> Yet have you nto once had the boldneſſe, to canvaſe theſe my arguments. Should I have paſſed through other <hi>Controverſies,</hi> is it not like, that you would have waved all under your common pretence, that they were but impertinent <hi>Digreſſions?</hi> But though you had keeped ſilence at other points, I think not ſo ſtrange, as that you could hear your <hi>Popes in cathedra and extra cathedram,</hi> charged with errour, and yet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake out of your Lethargie.

Wherupon now I muſt minde you, how Maſter <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> urged his adverſarie <hi>Maſter Knot,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>Romiſh</hi> catalogue of neceſſaries, aſſureing him, when ever he received that with the one hand, he ſhould deliver his catalogue with the other; but this could never be obtained from <hi>Maſter Knot.</hi> The like offer is lately made by <hi>Maſter Tillotſon,</hi> to <hi>Maſter Serjeant, the Author of Surefooting;</hi> but though <hi>Maſter Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant</hi> have made the faſhion of a Reply, yet hath he not adventured upon ſuch a <hi>Catalogue.</hi> But all theſe <hi>My five anſweres</hi> you paſſe, (ſo accurat an <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> are you,) except one branch of one reaſon, in my <hi>Fourth Reply,</hi> which alſo you miſrepreſent: For you propoſe it, as if I bad granted, that a catalogue of neceſſarie truths could not be drawne up, which you will not find in all my <hi>Paper.</hi> That which I ſaid, was, <hi>Cannot this general be proven, that all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, are contained in the Scripturs, unleſſe a preciſe catalogue of them be drawn?</hi> And I brought ſundrie inſtances to prove, that an univerſal propoſition, might be proven without an induction, and enumeration of al the particulars. Yea your ſelf here confeſſes, <hi>That when an univerſal propoſition is revealed, or that revealed, from whence it may be deduced then the univerſal propoſition may be beleeved, though the beleever cannot make an induction of particulars.</hi> Whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon I ſubſume, <hi>But in Scripture, that is revealed, from which it may be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101081:80"/>concluded by firme conſequence, that all things neceſſarie to Salvation are contained in Scripture, Ergo,</hi> by your confeſſion it muſt be granted, that this univerſal propoſition ought to be beleeved, <hi>That all neceſſarie truths are contained in Scripture, though a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of theſe truths could not be made.</hi> The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by all theſe Scripturs in which it is held forth, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſufficient <hi>In ſuo genere,</hi> as a rule to bring us to Salvation, which you will find accumulated by our divines, in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, <hi>De perfectione Scripturae.</hi> And I inſtanced ſome of them in my laſt Paper, purpoſlie to preoccupie this poor evaſion of yours, though you have not had the boldneſſe to medle with them.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:101081:81"/>therein.</hi> But this poor evaſion diſcovers groſſe ignorance, and inadverrence in you. For if you had remarked what I have ſaid, in the explication of the termes in my <hi>Firſt Paper,</hi> you would have ſeen this preoccupied. There I told you, that by <hi>The Religion of</hi> PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS, we underſtand onely, <hi>The True Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the holy Scripturs. And conſequently, where ever theſe things are revealed, which are neceſſarie, according to <hi>The True Chriſtian Religion,</hi> there alſo the neceſſarie points of <hi>Our Religion</hi> are revealed. And to evidence, that the Religion of PROTESTANTS, and the True Chriſtian Religion is the ſame, produce if you can any one point, which we hold as neceſſarie to Salvation, which is not neceſſarie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the True Chriſtian Religion revealed in Scripture, and I profeſſe, I will inſtantly diſowne it; and I know, ſo will all ingenuous PROTESTANTS. I Therefore warned you from the beginning, when you undertooke to impugne our Religion, that you undertooke the cauſe of an infidel, namely, to impugne the Chriſtian Religion. Hence, ſome have well obſerved, that they who would ſpeake properly, ſhould not terme our Religion, the PROTESTANT <hi>Religion,</hi> but the <hi>Religion of</hi> PROTESTANTS: It is not <hi>Religio</hi> PROTESTANS, but <hi>Religio</hi> PROTESTANTIVM; or the True Chriſtian Religion profeſſed by them, who doe reject and proteſt againſt <hi>Popiſh errors</hi> and inventions. Since therefore, all the points that are neceſſarie to Salvation, according to the True Chriſtian Religion, are revealed in Scripture; as hath been confirmed by luculent teſtimonies, both of Scripture, and Antiquity, (for I will not be addebted to you for your Conceſſions,) then all the points, which the <hi>Religion of</hi> PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS holds neceſſary to Salvation, are therein likewiſe revealed. And conſequently, as you would beleeve all the pieces in a purſe to be upright Gold, if it were atteſted to you, by a ſufficient authority: So you may beleeve all things neceſſarie to Salvation, to be contained in Scripture, this being atteſted by divine authoritie. Or if you will not acquieſce to all this evidence of reaſon, produce one article neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Salvation, or acknowledged by us to be ſuch, which is not contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture. Let it be brought to the Touch-ſtone and examined.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101081:81"/>But it ſeems, ye <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are more exact in trying your pieces of Gold, then points of Religion. For your pieces of gold, muſt either have the <hi>Atteſtation of a ſufficient authority, or be brought to the Touchſtone.</hi> But you can take the points of your Religion <hi>Implicitly</hi> upon truſt, and your intereſt ſo bribes your judgement and affections, that you will not come to the tryal, by which the cheat may be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>In your third Cavil, you had propounded ſundry idle <hi>Queries,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Means of interpretation of Scripture,</hi> inſinua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where you might have found a full account, of the right means of interpreting Scripture, and of the right way of uſeing theſe means, and conſequently, of the difference betwixt them that uſed them right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and others who doe not uſe them duely. <hi>Fourthly, I</hi> reſolved a <hi>Querie</hi> of yours, whether without the preaching of the Word, the means of interpretation may be uſed, and the true ſenſe of Scripture attained. But of all theſe things in your reply, like a perfect <hi>Fuge bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> you take no more notice, then to aſperſe them as long <hi>Digreſſions, about the rules of interpreting ſeripture:</hi> A rare and compendious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation I confeſſe. But if I did extravague in theſe diſcourſes, was it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101081:82"/>not in following ſuch a vagrant guide as you? Doe you not play the Devil firſt to temp: me to thſe <hi>D. greſſions,</hi> and then to accuſe me for them? Yea, doe you not ſhow your ſelf a ſilly fool, to wound your ſelf through my ſides. For if it be an impertinent <hi>Digreſſion</hi> for me to anſwere your Queries, muſt you not be an impertinent fool to propound them? But perhaps you thought it your wiſdome, rather to come off with this reflexion of folly, then to adventure to graple with theſe things, which would prove too hard for you. After you had waved all theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, leſt you ſhould ſeeme to ſay nothing at all to that Section, you fall upon a word, which I ſpake in anſwere to another of your judicious <hi>Queries. Viz. Whether theſe of a falſe Religion might duely uſe al the means of interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> To which I anſwered, <hi>De jure,</hi> they ought to uſe them, though <hi>De facto, and in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> they did not uſe them, which I confirmed by ſome Scripturs. To confute this my anſwere, <hi>What</hi> (ſay you,) <hi>if they of a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſay as much of as?</hi> And who queſtions but they may ſay it? <hi>Our lips are our own,</hi> (ſay the worſt of men,) <hi>And who is Lord over us, Pſal.</hi> 12 <hi>verſe</hi> 4. Have we not ſufficient experience of the licentious tongues of your <hi>Romaniſts?</hi> doth it therefore follow, that you doe duely uſe the means of interpretation, and not we? <hi>Si accuſare ſufficiat quis innocens?</hi> We doe not deſire any man to receive our expoſitions, becauſe we affirme them to be true: nor are we ſo brutiſh, as to ſuffer your <hi>Romiſh interpretations,</hi> to be obtruded upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us, on your bare affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If you would come downe out of the clouds, and not inſiſt ſtil on generals, you ſhould find it is upon convinceing grounds, from the ſeries of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, other Scripturs, the Analogie of faith, &amp;c. That we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject your <hi>Romiſh ſenſes,</hi> and embrace theſe which are approved by PROTESTANTS. As for <hi>Example,</hi> there is a great <hi>Controverſie</hi> betwixt you and us, touching the ſenſe of theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> This is my Body. You will have them to be underſtood, in <hi>A proper and lueral ſenſe,</hi> and by the Prieſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceing, or rather whiſpering them in Latine, the Body of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101081:82"/>Chriſt, to be ſubſtituted under the Accidents of bread: We on the contratie affirme, the ſenſe of theſe words, as is uſual in Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpeaches, to be <hi>Figurative;</hi> the Bread being called the Body of Chriſt, becauſe it is a Sacramental figne, and exhibitive Symbol of his Body. You will find Armies of arguments brought by our Divines, particularly, <hi>By Whitaker, Chamier, Morton, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenus, &amp;c.</hi> To juſtifie our ſenſe, and to confute yours, I ſhall at the time give you but a hint of this one. According to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Romiſn gloſſe,</hi> theſe words of Chriſt ſhould be inexplicable falſe, and imply a manifeſt contradiction, therefore you Romiſh gloſſe muſt ſurely be falſe. The <hi>Sequel</hi> is clear: The <hi>Antecedent</hi> I prove. And firſt I ſay, theſe words of Chriſt ſhould be inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. Straine your wit, and ſqueeze your Authors, to tell me what <hi>Hoc,</hi> or the pronowne <hi>This</hi> can ſignifie? Surely it can neither ſignify bread, nor the <hi>Accidents</hi> of bread, elſe the <hi>Propoſition</hi> were not proper: For al know, that one <hi>Disparat,</hi> cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly predicated of another. Nor can it ſignify <hi>The Body of Chriſt:</hi> For according to you Chriſts Body, is not there until al the <hi>Words</hi> be finiſhed. But the pronowne <hi>This,</hi> doth clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat ſomething. then preſent, when it was ſpoken. What therefore remains, but that with other your Authors, you betake your ſelf to the deſperat refuge of your <hi>Individun<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vagum, Eus in confuſo, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentum ſub speciebus,</hi> and what is that, but ſomething you know not what?

More of the <hi>Vertigo</hi> of your authors, touching this particular, may be ſeen in the forementiond writers. But I not onely ſaid, that this
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101081:83"/>
                  <hi>Propoſition</hi> of Chriſt, according to your <hi>Romiſh</hi> gloſſe, would be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable,</hi> but alſo <hi>Falſe,</hi> and <hi>Imply a contradiction.</hi> For it implyes a manifeſt contradiction, that a true affirmative propoſition <hi>De prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti,</hi> ſhould produce its object. But this propoſition, which muſt be true, as being Chriſts, and which all ſee to be affirmative <hi>De prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti,</hi> according to your <hi>Romiſh gloſſe,</hi> doth produce its object. For ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to you, it ſubſtitutes the Body of Chriſt under the accidents of bread, either by <hi>Adduction,</hi> or <hi>Reproduction. Ergo,</hi> this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to your <hi>Romiſh gloſſe,</hi> implyes a manifeſt <hi>Contradiction.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, becauſe, if a true propoſition <hi>De praeſenti,</hi> ſhould produce its object, then in the <hi>Iustant of nature,</hi> wherein the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is conceived before its object, as the cauſe before its effect, the propoſition ſhould be true, and not true. <hi>True, ex hypotheſi,</hi> for it is ſuppoſed to be a true propoſition. <hi>Not true,</hi> becauſe, not conforme to its object: For it affirmes its object to be <hi>De praeſenti;</hi> yet in that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of nature,</hi> the object is not; for it is the inſtant of <hi>Priority</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the object: And conſequently, if this propoſition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> doe ſubſtitute Chriſts Body under the accidents of bread, His Body ſhould be under theſe accidents, before it be under them. For it ſhould be under them in the firſt <hi>Inſtant of nature,</hi> wherein this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is conceived, elſe the propoſition ſhould be falſe: And yet it ſhould not be under them, becauſe the propoſition, as the productive cauſe of the preſence of Chriſt, muſt be preſuppoſed for <hi>One inſtant of nature,</hi> before its effect. But what ſpeake <hi>I</hi> of <hi>Inſtants of nature? Is</hi> it not at leaſt requited, to the truth of an <hi>Affirmative propoſition de praeſenti,</hi> that the object thereof, doe exiſt in that article of time, wherein the <hi>Copula</hi> of the propoſition is pronounced? But according to you, Chriſt Body is not under the accidents of bread, when the <hi>Copula</hi> of the propoſition is pronounced: for according to you, Chriſts Body is not in the Sacrament, till all the <hi>Words</hi> be ended. Therefore, the propoſition according to your <hi>Gloſſe,</hi> cannot be true. And yet it muſt be true, as being the word of him who is truth it ſelf: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, it muſt be <hi>Ture</hi> and <hi>Not True.</hi> Your Schoolmen have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed themſelves with theſe <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> but could never extricat
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:101081:83"/>themſelves out of this labyrinth, in ſo much, that what one of them affirmes, the other confutes. As theſe hints prove the falſhood of your <hi>Romiſh gloſſe,</hi> ſo the truth of the ſenſe given by PROTESTANTS, is manifeſt from the <hi>Series</hi> of the context. For, if by the pronowne, <hi>Hoc,</hi> or <hi>This,</hi> Chriſt meaned the bread, then the ſenſe of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition muſt be figurative: But by the pronowne, <hi>This,</hi> he ſurely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the bread, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, becauſe diſparats cannot be predicated of one another, but <hi>Figuratively.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is eaſily proven: Becauſe, what he tooke, bleſſed and did breake, of that he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> as is clear from the <hi>Series</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text: But undoubtedly he tooke, bleſſed and brake the bread, therefore it was the bread which he did demonſtrate by the pronowne, <hi>This.</hi> And conſequently, the ſenſe muſt be <hi>Figurative.</hi> Neither is this a late invention of PROTESTANTS.

               <p>In your next ſection, as you declined a tryal by Scripture, ſo likewiſe you ſhun to have your Religion tryed by <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and you pretend two noble ſhifts. <hi>The first is, that according to us, al theſe in the firſt three Centuries were fallible, and therefore, though our Religion were conforme to theirs, it will not follow that it is the True Religion.</hi> I doubt, if ever any had to doe with ſuch a ſhameleſſe tergiverſing fellow. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſuppoſe it were true, that our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines did ſay that all theſe of the three firſt Centuries were <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi> yet if you grant their Religion to be the True Religion, and I admit their Religion as to all eſſentials, to be a Teſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ours be true, or not, with what face can you decline it? Know you not that Maxim of Law, <hi>Testem quem quis inducit pre ſe, tenetur recipere contraſe.

But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by ſaying <hi>That we mantains, that all in theſe ages,</hi> (even excepting the Apoſtles, and pen-men of holy writ,) <hi>were fallible, and ſubject to errors,</hi> you diſcover your ſelf, to be either groſly ignorant of the judgement of PROTESTANTS, or to be a baſe ſcurvie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101081:84"/>which will appeare, by diſtinguiſhing two words in your aſſertion. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> the particle <hi>(All,)</hi> may be taken either <hi>Collectively,</hi> or <hi>Diſtributively.</hi> And <hi>Secondly, Errors of Religion</hi> are of two ſorts: Some in points fundamental and eſſential, ſome in points which are not of ſuch indiſpenſable neceſſity. This being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, I propoſe this <hi>Diſtinction.</hi> If you meane, that we mantaine that <hi>All</hi> in theſe ages <hi>Collectively taken,</hi> that is, the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, may erre in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> it is a moſt abſurd falſhood; for PROTESTANTS mantaine no ſuch thing. We acknowledge the promiſes for the perpetuity of the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28, <hi>ver,</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if the whole <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church collectively taken</hi> did err in <hi>Fundamentals</hi> in any age, then the Church for that time ſhould utterly ceaſe to be upon earth. It is True ſundrie of your Writers, either through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or through their calumniating <hi>Genius,</hi> have charged this on PROTESTANTS, that they mantaine, that the Church may ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fail. But this is ſo impudent a ſlander, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is aſhamed of it, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De Eccleſia Militants, cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Notandum</hi> (ſayeth he,) <hi>Multos ex nostris tempus terere dum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant abſolute Eccleſiam non poſſe deſicere, nam Calvinus &amp; cateri Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici id concedunt.</hi> If therefore this be your meaning, you charge PROTESTANTS falſly. But if you onely meane, that <hi>All</hi> in theſe ages taken <hi>Diſtributively.</hi> (remember that now we ſpeake not of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or of pen-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy writ, or of theſe who had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinatie Prophetick ſpirit,) might erre in things not <hi>Fundamental,</hi> this is granted. Yet this hinders not, but that the truth of our Religion, may be proven by its conformity with the faith of the <hi>Ancient Church.</hi> For though every one <hi>Diſtributively</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken may erre in <hi>Integrals,</hi> yet, ſeeing, <hi>Al collectivly taken,</hi> or the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Church cannot erre in <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> if the faith of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church in theſe ages, can be found out in the undoubted writings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in theſe times, then <hi>Conformity with their Religion</hi> will irrefragably prove <hi>Our Religion</hi> to be the <hi>True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as to all <hi>Eſſentials.</hi> Yea, if from the writings of the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Distinction,</hi> which I have propoſed, is not mine onely, but of our PROTESTANT Writers, in this queſtion, concerning <hi>The Churches infallibility.</hi> As you may ſee in <hi>Whitaker, De Eccleſia, quaeſt.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Doctor Field, His way to the Church, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap</hi> 2. And others. So that it is no evaſion I propound to you, but the received Doctrine of the Reformed Churches; and hence the reſt of this your cavil, on which you fooliſhly dilate, may be cut off. <hi>If we grant,</hi> ſay you, <hi>Any infallibility to the Church in theſe three Centuries, how did that gift expyre in the fourth, and after following ages?</hi> It is eaſily <hi>Anſwered:</hi> This infall blility which we grant to the <hi>Collective body of the Church,</hi> as to the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> and <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of faith, agrees to her in every age; elſe the Church in ſome ages ſhould be utterly loſt, But though we grant, that the whole <hi>Catholick Church</hi> cannot erre in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> be not ſo fooliſh, as to apply this to your <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> You might as well ſay, that <hi>Italians</hi> are the collective body of mankind, as that you <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are the collective body of the Catholick Church. Remember <hi>Jeroms</hi> ſmart admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>In Aepiſtola ad Evagrium. Orbis major eſt urbe.</hi> Only this I adde, that though the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> be exempted from error in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> in every age; yet the Church in all ages, is not bleſt with <hi>Equal purity, and splendor.</hi> For in ſome ages, the <hi>Integrals</hi> may be much more vitiated then in others. Yea, ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, may erre in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and ſo ceaſe to be True Churches, and many of theſe who were eminent Lights in the Church, may be ſmitten with theſe <hi>Fundamental errors,</hi> and the ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the truth, may be reduced to a great Paucitie, and through perſecution, be ſcattered into corners, as in the dayes of <hi>Athanaſius, Quando totus orbis miratus eſt ſe factum Arianum.</hi> Leſt therefore you cavil further, at the reſtricting of my argument to theſe <hi>First three Centuries,</hi> you may remember the firſt occaſion of it, which was
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101081:85"/>this, as you will find in my <hi>Fourth Paper:</hi> I was ſpeaking of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Apologiſts,</hi> in the firſt <hi>Three Centuries,</hi> who pleaded the truth of the Chriſtian Religion againſt Heathens. And I appealed both to <hi>Their grounds,</hi> and their Religion in theſe dayes, that it might be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether our Religion were not agreeable to theirs in all <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,</hi> and whether the ſolid grounds which they brought, for the truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> did not agree to the <hi>Religion of</hi> PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS? This I ſay, was the occaſion of limiting the argument to theſe ages; though it might have been extended further. Yea, and (as then we told,) was extended further by <hi>Biſhop Juel,</hi> and <hi>Crak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthorp,</hi> even to the <hi>Sixth Centurie;</hi> ſo alſo, is it by learned <hi>Whitaker, Contra rarionem quintam Campiani:</hi> Nay others have extended it to all ages. Nor need you carp, at the limiting of the argument to the firſt <hi>Three Centuries:</hi> For the faith of the Catholick Church in theſe <hi>Three ages,</hi> was the faith of the Catholick Church in all <hi>Ages.</hi> For there is but one <hi>Faith,</hi> and therefore, if it be proven, that our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, was the Religion of theſe ages, it doth conſequently follow, that it was the faith of the Catholick Church in all ages. So that this is the moſt compendious way, to try, whether a Religion be the faith of the Church in all ages, by aſcending to the fountain: I mean, to theſe firſt three centuries, concerning which there is leaſt doubt made by any Party; and which was leſſe viriated by ſuperſtition, or errors in integrals, then was the Church in ſome after times.</p>
               <p>I come now to your ſecond <hi>Evaſion,</hi> wherein you pretend, <hi>That conformity with the Ancient Church, is at leaſt no diſtinct ground from conformity with the Scriptures; ſeeing the truth of the faith of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, can onely be proven, by its conformity with the Scripturs.</hi> But the vanity of this ſubterfuge, doth eaſily appeare. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a <hi>Diſtinct ground</hi> or not, yet if it be a <hi>Real ground,</hi> why de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline you to be tryed thereby? You muſt ſurely have an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and know your wares to be ſophiſticat, that they cannot abide the light. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If theſe grounds be not diſtinct, how doth your <hi>Melehior Canus, In his booke of commone places,</hi> diſtinguiſh them, give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt place to the <hi>Seripturs,</hi> of which he treats <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. &amp; only the <hi>Sixth</hi> to Ancient fathers, of whome he diſcourſeth, <hi>Lib.</hi> 7?

                  </gap>s founded on <hi>Scripture,</hi> from the arguments founded upon <hi>Antiquity?</hi> But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> wholly to remove this cavil, I grant that the truth of Religion in any former age, may be proven from its conformity with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and therefore, that conformity with the holy Scriptures, is the onely <hi>Primarie ground</hi> of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a True Religion from a falſe; whereupon, I did put it in the firſt place. Yet we may abſtract, <hi>Pro hîc &amp; nune,</hi> from this way of procedour, and argue from the faith of the Church in ſome ages, without proceeding at the time, to examine the truth of every point by the <hi>Scripture:</hi> And the rather, ſeeing in Scripture there are general promiſes of the perpetuity of the Church, and conſequently of preſerving in her all fundamental truths. If therefore we can have evidence, that this was the faith of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> I meane of the whole collective in any age, then I may conclude, this is the true faith, and the <hi>True Religion;</hi> and conſequently, what is agreeable thereto, muſt alſo be the <hi>True Religion:</hi> for nothing can be conſonant to truth, but truth. From this it appeares, that ſiſting in the Religion of the Catholick Church in the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Centurie.</hi> as a <hi>Principle,</hi> upon the general promiſe of the Churches perpetuity, without a further progreſſe, (for the time,) to examine the truth of every particular, it may become in ſome manner, a <hi>Diſtinct ground</hi> of argueing, from that according to which, every point is ſeverally reduced to <hi>Scripture-tryal.</hi> Even as in <hi>Subalternas ſciences,</hi> the <hi>Concluſions</hi> of the <hi>Subalternant ſcience</hi> are made uſe of as <hi>Principles,</hi> without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a further progreſſe. The <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> takes the <hi>Geometricians Concluſion</hi> as a <hi>Priuciple,</hi> not ſeeking a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> thereof. So may the <hi>Divine</hi> in ſome caſes take the faith of the Catholick Church, in the <hi>Second</hi> or <hi>Third Centurie,</hi> and argue thence as from a <hi>Principle;</hi> eſpecially, when he hath to doe with an Adverſarie, who may admit the faith of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> as a <hi>Test,</hi> and will decline the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> under pretext of obſcarity. or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity. Yea, (as I have ſaid before,) <hi>A Divine</hi> may in ſuch a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101081:86"/>caſe, argue from the faith of one true <hi>Particular Church.</hi> Suppoſe that an <hi>Original writ,</hi> were either loſt, or blotted and blurred, from which there hath been ſeveral <hi>Tranſumpts</hi> taken; and that there were two perſons pretending to have <hi>Tranſumpts,</hi> but each of them, queſtioning the fidelity of the others <hi>Tranſumpt.</hi> This <hi>Queſtion</hi> could not be decided by the <hi>Original,</hi> it being ſuppoſed, either to be loſt, or blotted utterly, and blurred, and neither of the two Parties willing yeeld to one another. But there being found another <hi>Tranſump,</hi> which both the Parties acknowledge, to have been the <hi>Firſt Copie,</hi> that was taken from the <hi>Original,</hi> Could there be any way ſo good for decyding the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> (next to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareing of both the <hi>Tranſumpts,</hi> with the <hi>Original,</hi> if it could be had, or were clear,) as to compare the two controverted <hi>Copies,</hi> with this uncontroverted <hi>Tranſumpt?</hi> In this caſe, would not he who ſhunned to bring his <hi>Copie</hi> to the tryall, leave a ſtrong preſumption, that his Paper were but a forged draught? Now though all the authority, which the unqueſtioned <hi>Tranſumpt</hi> hath, was derived from its conformity with the <hi>Original,</hi> yet in theſe circumſtances, it may have the place of a <hi>Teſt,</hi> to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt true and adulterat <hi>Copies.</hi> The application is obvious. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> like old Hereticks, accuſe <hi>Scriptures</hi> as being blotted and blurred, yea as in a manner loſt: The <hi>Originals,</hi> if you may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, being corrupted; albeit indeed Scripture is clear, and by the good hand of GOD preſerved to this day. Yet ſeeing you ſometimes ſeeme to magnify <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as if you did acknowledge the faith of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> to be a faithful <hi>Tranſumpt</hi> from that authentick <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> what more condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, can we PROTESTANTS in this caſe ſhow to you, Then ſeeing you will not be judged by the Scriptures, which are out Heavenly Fathers authentick <hi>Teſtament,</hi> then I ſay, to acquieſce, that the cauſe betwixt us be tryed by that <hi>Tranſumpt,</hi> which you ſeeme to acknowledge? And when you decline this tryal alſo, doth it not ſpeake you out to be real <hi>Prevaricators</hi> and <hi>Cavillers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe ſome may wonder whence it is, that you doe not

Now, onely I ſhall deſire you to conſider this <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, à poſteriori.</hi> Your Propounders have certainly erred <hi>De facte.</hi> and <hi>Dogmatically,</hi> both in <hi>Cathedra, &amp; Extre Cathedram,</hi> as I ſhew in my <hi>Sixth Paper;</hi> therefore it is impoſſible to aſſigne a ſolid
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101081:89"/>ground, why their <hi>Infallibility</hi> ſhould be beleeved by a <hi>Divine faith,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe your divine faith be of ſuch a nature, that by it, you may aſſent unto falſhoods. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> I adde this that the whole foundation of your ſubterfuge, is a groſſe falſhood, namely, that there are <hi>Motives of credibility,</hi> which doe evidently conclude the infallibility of your Propounders. Produce if you can theſe <hi>Motives,</hi> and frame your arguments from them; and I undertake, through the grace of GOD, <hi>(Sub periculo cauſae,)</hi> to diſcover the falſhood and fallacie of them. In the meane time, leſt you runne from the point, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, that the <hi>Queſtion</hi> betwixt us, is, whether there be ſuch <hi>Motives of credibility,</hi> which doe <hi>Evidently prove</hi> your Propounders to be <hi>Infallible?</hi> And therefore take heede you digreſſe not to ſpeake of the <hi>Motives,</hi> which perſwade the <hi>Credibility</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> For the Chriſtian Religion may be <hi>Credible,</hi> though we have no previous aſſurance, that your Propounders are <hi>Infallible.</hi> Could I find an evident demonſtration, of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder, I ſhould inſtantly captivat my underſtanding to ſuch a Perſone. Demonſtrat therefore from your <hi>Motives of credibility,</hi> that your Propounders are <hi>Infallible,</hi> and produce a ſolid <hi>Formal Object</hi> of the firſt <hi>Aſſent of faith</hi> thereto, and I ſhall ingenuouſly acknowledge, that you have made your eſcape from the <hi>Contradiction</hi> objected to you. But if you doe not demonſtrat their <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as I am ſure you cannot, be you as ingenuous on the other hand to acknowledge, that you are ſhut up in a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> as in yron chaines; and that thither you are led by the <hi>Principles of your Religion.</hi> From theſe things, the impertinency of your example, taken from <hi>Attrition</hi> and <hi>Contrition,</hi> may appeare, <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it is clear from Scripture, that <hi>Attrition</hi> doth uſualy goe before <hi>Contrition.</hi> But that an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of your Propounders, muſt goe before every act of <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> can no way be proven, either by Scripture, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, or your <hi>Motives of credibility,</hi> as ſhall be made evident, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutione argument or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>?</hi> Next, becauſe <hi>Attrition,</hi> and <hi>Contrition,</hi> have diſtinct and aſſignable <hi>Formal objects,</hi> as is both confeſſed by your ſelf, and might be luculently alſo cleared from Scripture. But
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:101081:89"/>the <hi>Formal object,</hi> of this firſt pretended <hi>Aſſent of divine faith,</hi> to the <hi>Infallibility of your Propounders,</hi> is not aſſignable, as hath been ſhewed already. It might here be a divertiſement to the Reader, to give an account of the Vertigo of your Authors, concerning theſe <hi>Motives of credibility.</hi> They who are curious, may find a touch of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinions in your <hi>Cardinal De Lugo, tract. De fide Diſp.</hi> 5 <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.2.3. But at this time alſo, I have purpoſly waved the abſurdities, which our Divines have deduced from your <hi>Romiſh Doctrine,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe <hi>Motives of credibility;</hi> Becauſe, I would keepe you cloſſe to the point. And therefore, I ſhall demand no more of you, but that you demonſtrate the <hi>Infallibility of your Propounders,</hi> from theſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of credibility,</hi> which till you doe, you remaine ſhut up within the lines of that objected <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Now proceed to the other difficulty objected to you, in exped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf from which you are as unhappie, For evidenceing whereof, there needs no more be ſaid, but to propoſe the <hi>Aenigma,</hi> which you pretended to enervat; for you craftily wrap it up in ſilence. The <hi>Argument</hi> did runne thus: If our faith muſt be built upon the Precognition of the <hi>Infallible</hi> aſſiſtance of your Propounders, the either this their pretended <hi>Infallibility,</hi> can be proven or not. If not, then the whole <hi>Romiſh Faith</hi> is built upon a <hi>Fancy,</hi> which cannot be proven. If it can, then <hi>First</hi> you were required to produce your <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> for proving it. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> you were perſued by this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma.</hi> If the <hi>Infallibility of your Propounders</hi> can be proven, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a <hi>Writen</hi> or <hi>Unwriten Word.</hi> Not by a <hi>Writen Word,</hi> ſeeing the ſenſe of it cannot be known, according to you, untill firſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Propounder,</hi> and <hi>Interpreter</hi> be known; but now that is ſuppoſed to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the very point in controverſie. Not can it be proven by an <hi>Unwriten Word:</hi> Both becauſe you had aſſerted before, <hi>That a point of Religion to be True, and to be conforme to the writen word, are Synomma's;</hi> And becauſe there is as much need of an <hi>Infallible Propounder,</hi> that we may be aſſured of the truth, and true meaning of an <hi>Unwriten word,</hi> as of that which is writen. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we cannot know the ſenſe of the <hi>Writen word,</hi> till firſt we be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101081:90"/>aſſured of the <hi>Propounders infallibility,</hi> neither can the truth, or the true ſenſe of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwriten word</hi> be known, till firſt we be aſſured of the <hi>Propounders infallibility;</hi> and conſequently, when the thing to be proven is his <hi>Infallibility,</hi> it cannot be proven at all, either by a writen, or an unwriten word. This <hi>Argument</hi> you dared not to propound, and make a formal anſwere thereunto. But all you ſay to this <hi>Suppreſſed Argument,</hi> is, that when you affirmed, <hi>That a point of Religion to be true, and to be conforme to the writen word of GOD, were Synonima's, you ſpake it onely Ad Hominem.</hi> This is all your Reply, and ſuppoſe it were true, let any who hath ſenſe judge whether you have evacuated the <hi>Argument.</hi> For you touch but one part of the confirmation, of one branch of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,</hi> which is abundantly prove<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by another reaſon, which might ſuffice, ſuppoſe that which you touch were wholly laid aſide. You are far from the gallant reſolution of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Nola furari Victoriam.</hi> Nay you are ſo baſe, that when you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſolve an <hi>Argument,</hi> you wrape it up from the knowledge of the <hi>Reader,</hi> and having given a touch of that, without which the <hi>Argument</hi> abydes in its entire force, you have the confidence to give out, that you have confuted the whole <hi>Argument.</hi> This is not the firſt experience, I have of your <hi>Ieſuitical</hi> ingenuitie. But I muſt adde, that even that which you have ſaid cannot be admitted, as if the <hi>Equipollencie</hi> of the two forementioned <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,</hi> had onely been aſſerted by you <hi>Ad Hominem:</hi> And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe what you ſay in this, is agreeable to the grounds which you lay downe in your <hi>First Paper,</hi> which there, <hi>Intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> you affirme, ſhould be agreeed unto by all. Now the chief ſcope of the <hi>Firſt Paper,</hi> and <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> is to hold out, that the True Religion hath grounds to prove it ſelf, to be conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of the word of GOD. And therfore, both in my anſwere to your <hi>Firſt Paper,</hi> and in my <hi>Anſwere</hi> to your <hi>Third,</hi> wherein you had aſſerted the <hi>Equipollencie of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,</hi>

Or elſe they muſt be perfect <hi>Enthuſiaſts.</hi> If they have a reaſone, why may not the ſame reaſone that moved them, move the people alſo, when it is ſufficiently propoſed to them? Let the indifferent Reader now obſerve to what fluctuating uncertaintes you expoſe your hearers whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſay, that their faith muſt be reſolved upon the authority of the Speaker, whether you meane <hi>Pope</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> or both, for I ſuppoſe you cannot determinatly tell which of the three. Now how many things are here to be cleared, before the faith of the poor people can be at a ſtand?

               <p>But I muſt here reveal another prodigious <hi>Myſterie</hi> of your <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</hi> Namely, that what ever is propoſed, not onely by your <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> but alſo by your inferiour <hi>Clergie-Men,</hi> though by your own Confeſſion <hi>Fallible,</hi> yet the poor People, who cannot examine by themſelves the truth or falſhood of what is propoſed, ought not onely to beleeve upon the authority of the ſaid <hi>Fallible Clergie-Men,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Doe merit by beleeving,</hi> though the thing beleeved be <hi>Erronious, and Heretical.</hi> Hear this from your <hi>Great Caſuist, Cardinal Talet, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>De Instruct.

               <p>As for your ludicrous <hi>Example</hi> of an <hi>Old Wife:</hi> We bleſs <hi>God,</hi> there are old Wiwes, young Boyes, and Girles amongſt us, who could inſtruct all old deceiver like you, in the true grounds of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR <hi>Seventh Paper</hi> did come to my hands the fourth of November, and I doe not wonder of your long ſilence, of near three moneths, for it is patched up of ſo various and copious <hi>Digreſſions,</hi> copied out, as it ſeems, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie bookes; that you will ſcarce find one of twenty, that will take the paines to read only over: And to make it grow, you have adjoined a long and tedious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, about <hi>Real preſence,</hi> which appearingly is the ſubſtance of all you taught your Scholars this laſt Year.</p>
               <p>But all this your painful labour for ſo many moneths is loſt, ſince as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes I have proteſted to you, that I take no notice of things out of the way: Neither will begiune any other thing, before we have fully ended the maine point.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:101081:93"/>
               <p>This debate was occaſioned of a continual <hi>Railing,</hi> made by you in the Pulpit againes Catholick Religion, but with ſuch ingenuity, out of that your <hi>Chaire of Verity,</hi> that in place of <hi>Catholick Dogmes</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, you did often ſubſtitute and propone, in a ridiculous manner to the people <hi>Problematick opinions,</hi> holden by ſome Scholaſtickes and Caſuiſts, as manifestly appeared out of the conference we had by mouth. Whether this did proceed out of groſs <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Malice,</hi> or out of both, I remit to your ſelf.</p>
               <p>Seeing that you did ſhow ſo great fervour in skaring your Auditors from Catholick Religion, you were deſired to confirme them in their own Religion, by produceing ſome ſolid, but special ground and principle, whereby might be proven the truth of the <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Religion. And though in the beginning, under the pretext that you had onely the Defenders part, you ſtood ſtiffe, not to be obliged to this. Yet becauſe, you ſaw that it could not conſist with the reputation of a man in your place, to play altogether the Dumme, in a matter of Religion of ſo great concernment, as is the putting in queſtion, whether the <hi>PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANT</hi> Religion be a True Religion or not, leſt this declineing ſhould be imputed either to your ignorance, or to the want of poſitive grounds, after that with defuſe digreſſions of all ſorts, you did runne your ſelf as it were out of breath, <hi>At long lang length,</hi> you were forced to have your recouſe to the <hi>Old jock trot,</hi> that your <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Authors teaches you, to wit, that your Religion is proven to be true by this <hi>Medium</hi> or principle, becauſe it is grounded upon Scripture, and conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, <hi>As containing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuouſly all things neceſſarie for mans Salvation.</hi> This then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by your own confeſſion, the chief and moſt plauſible ground for the truth of your Religion, you are deſired to lay aſid all other things, &amp; hold you at this preciſly, until you make it good and proportion at to confirme your own <hi>PROTESTANTS,</hi> in their Religion.</p>
               <p>You ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>en that your Religion is proven to be a True Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is grounded upon Scripture, and conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture. But it cannot be ſhowen that it is conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, excep firſt it be ſhowen that you
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101081:94"/>have the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture. <hi>Ergo,</hi> to make this good, you must firſt produce ſome special ground or principle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a judicious man may be reaſonably induced to think that you have the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, that is to ſay, the ſenſe intended by the holy Ghoſt. For as it is impoſſible that a thing be conforme to a true ſenſe, except it be ſupponed that there be a true ſenſe, ſo it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſhow or prove a thing to be conforme to the true ſenſe, except it be firſt ſhown and proven that there is a true ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Al then that is required of you, is, that you produce ſome special ground or principle, to make it appeare, that you have the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, ſince all the rest depends upon this onely one thing, and that the ground which you produce to prove this, be ſuch, as cannot equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve to prove a falſe Religion, acknowledged by your ſelf for a falſe Religion, to have the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbes upon you, if you will vindicat your Religion from this foul note, that there can be ſhown no difference betwixt it and a falſe Religion; And conſequently, that it is impoſſible, that your Religion can be ſhown or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be a True Religion. And it is expected that you will performe this, with a clear Subſtantious, Laconick, and School-way, laying altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſide your diffuſe reviling Pulpit way.</p>
               <p>It is fatal to you, to cloſe your Paper with braging, and praiſing your ſelf, and extolling your own anſweres, and withall, to undervailne all that is brought againſt you, but this as other things doe not reach to the maine point.</p>

               <p>And <hi>First,</hi> you ſay, <hi>That this debate was occaſioned by our continual railing againſt your pretended Catholick Religion.</hi> As if it were our cuſtome, to charge your <hi>Religion</hi> falſly with theſe things which you doe not mantaine. A great crime I acknowedge, if it were a truth. But why did you not for the ſatisfaction of the Reader, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, inſtance ſome of theſe falſhoods? Doe you not hereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſeſt the calumniating genius, by which you have been acted all along? Know therefore that we PROTESTANTS hold it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to lie for GOD. <hi>Job.</hi> 13.7. The truth of GOD needs not mens lies to ſupport it. Did I ſee that the PROTESTANT cauſe could not be mantained without calumnies and falſhoods, I ſhould inſtantly diſowne it, as not being of GOD. I reckone it my mercie, that I have been help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome meaſure, to give a faithful teſtimony againſt the <hi>Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Poperie,</hi> and wil account it my duety ſo to doe while I live. I have inded ſaid it from <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and I hope I have alſo made it good, that your <hi>Romiſh Doctors</hi> have corrupted much, both of the <hi>Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticals,</hi> and <hi>Practicals of Chriſtianity.</hi> And what I have ſaid herein, I ſhall be readie, through the grace of GOD, to mantaine, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> as you, but the whole unhallowed crew of <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> This hath been often charged upon you, and demonſtrated againſt you by our Divines. But becauſe I ſee you are not for large Volumes, I ſhall remit you at preſent, onely to a little, but learned tractare to this purpoſe, writen by <hi>Doctor Jeremy Taylor,</hi> Entituled, <hi>A Diſſuaſive from Poperie.</hi> But what? Doeth a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> accuſe us of <hi>Railing?</hi> Doth not the World know, that perſidious lying and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, are the <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> the holy (I ſhould have ſaid Helliſh) Chears whereby their cauſe is mantained? Have they ever been able to wipe off thoſe ſtaines, which <hi>Watſon</hi> their own <hi>Romiſh ſecular Prieſt</hi> fixed upon their ſocietie, in ſo much, that he is not afraid to ſay, that <hi>Lucian Machiavel,</hi> yea and <hi>Don Lucifer might goe to ſchool and learne Satanical practiſes from your Jeſuits.</hi> And as for you, is it not too too apparent by all theſe your Papers, that you ſerve for nothing unleſſe it be to rail and lie like a <hi>Shimet?</hi> At arguing have you not proven, according to the Proverb, <hi>Quaeſi aſinus ad lyram?</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

               </p>
               <p>You are pleaſed, <hi>Secondly,</hi> to ſay, <hi>That in ſtead of impugning your Catholick dogmes,</hi> (as you terme them,) <hi>We propound to the people, and that in a radiculous manner,</hi> (ſo gravely forſoth doe you oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us,) <hi>Problematick points out of your Caſuiſts and Schoolmen.</hi> If you <hi>Ieſuits</hi> were not Perſons <hi>Effrontis impr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bitatis &amp; linguae effrauis,</hi> habituated in confident aſſerting of lies, would you not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the truth of this report, before you had given it under your hand? Whether we behave our ſelves ridiculouſly in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, grave Auditors can witneſſe. Indeed if the <hi>Supremacie of your Pope, and the infallibility of your Church,</hi> if your <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſſe,</hi> it your <hi>Adoring of Images, and invocating of Saincts and Angels,</hi> if your <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> and <hi>Praying for the Dead, &amp;c.</hi> If theſe I ſay, and ſuch as theſe, be the <hi>Proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick points</hi> you ſpeake of: Them I confeſſe we doe publickly propound and ſolidly confute. If theſe be onely <hi>Problemes,</hi> which a man may innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly affirme or deny, why for oppoſing theſe, doe you <hi>Romaniſts</hi> anathematize PROTESTANTS? Why have you brunt ſo many of them alive, and cruelly imbrewed your hands in the blood of ſo many thouſands of them? Sometimes (I deny not,) occaſions may occurre of ſpeaking concerning the particular tenets of ſome of your <hi>Doctors.</hi> But then judcious Hearers can beare us witneſſe, (for we teach nothing in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,) that we no otherwayes repreſent theſe, then as the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch <hi>Doctors.</hi> This appeared when I was confuting from Pulpit, that impious tenet (which I ſuppoſe is the <hi>Probleme</hi> you hint at,) of many of your <hi>Doctors, That a ſinner is not bound by the law of GOD, immediatly after he hath ſinued to repent.</hi> For in Pulpit I did onely charge it upon many of your <hi>Doctors.</hi> But though we be ſo ingenuous in repreſenting the tenets of your <hi>Doctors,</hi> I ſhall deſire you to confider, what a ſtaine and reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe impious tenets of particular <hi>Doctors</hi> among you leave
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101081:96"/>upon your <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> Are they not publiſhed with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of your <hi>Authoriſed Licencers of books</hi> as containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>Contrary to the Catholick Faith?</hi> Are either Authors or Licencers of the books cenſured by your Church? Have not your <hi>Expurgatoris indices</hi> deleted much better ſtuffe in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings boon of Ancient and Moderne Authors, whereof you may find many examples in <hi>Doctor Iames,</hi> his excellent booke of <hi>The corruption of Scriptures, Councils, and Fathers, by the Prelats, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and Pillars of the Church of Rome, part.</hi> 4? But the impious tenets or your <hi>Caſuiſts and Schoolmen,</hi> ſtend uncenſured with the approbation of your <hi>Authoriſed Licencers,</hi> to the eternal ignominy of your Church.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly, it appeared,</hi> ſay you, <hi>By the Conference betwixt us, that we often propounded in Pulpit, problematick points in stead of your Dogm's.</hi> How ſo I pray you? Was there nothing ſpoken of in that conference, but of School-Problems? Did I not conclude the impietie of your Romiſh Religion, becauſe it deſtroyes all cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of divine faith from your <hi>Florentine and Tridentine Canons,</hi> which ſuſpend the efficacie of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> from the intention of the Adminiſtrator? For all certainty of divine faith accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, <hi>Is grounded upon the infallible aſſiſtance of your clergie.</hi> But if <hi>Ordination,</hi> which is one of your <hi>Romiſh Sacraments,</hi> depend upon the intention of the Ordainer, you can have no certainty of faith, who are your <hi>Clergie men,</hi> or who have this pretended <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſiſtance.</hi> For how can you be certaine of other mens inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions? To this you had not the confidence to make any Reply. Can you ſay that this is a meer <hi>Problem?</hi> Are the <hi>Canons of Councils prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> with you? Is it a <hi>Probleme</hi> among you, whether that be an impious Religion which deſtroyes all certainty of faith?</p>
               <p>But perhaps you will ſay, <hi>There was another queſtion toſſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man after he hath ſinned be bound preſently to repent.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and the ſober Chriſtian may judge, how much that man dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> who affirmes this to be a <hi>Problematick point.</hi> Yet to put a ſtop to your lying miſrepreſentations, concerning
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:101081:97"/>this particular. <hi>I</hi> muſt crave leave to doe theſe two things, <hi>I</hi> ſhall firſt give a true account, how that Queſtion concerning Repentance, came to be moved at the <hi>Conference;</hi> and in Order to this, <hi>I</hi> muſt give a touch of the occaſion of the <hi>Conference</hi> ſit ſelf. <hi>Secondly, I</hi> ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine a little, whether that point may juſtly be reckoned among <hi>Prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems,</hi> and how far it may be charged upon your <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> You may readily exclaime on theſe diſcourſes, as <hi>Digreſſions,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> am drawne to them by your Calumnies.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> the real occaſion of that <hi>Conference,</hi> and of moving that <hi>Queſtion</hi> at the <hi>Conference,</hi> was this. <hi>In April</hi> laſt, <hi>I</hi> received two challenges from a <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> of your profeſſion. The <hi>First</hi> was, that <hi>I</hi> had wronged your <hi>Authors,</hi> by affirming ſome dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a <hi>Sermon,</hi> concerning <hi>Repentance,</hi> that many of your <hi>Doctors</hi> did mantaine, <hi>That when people ſinne, they are not bound immediatly to repent.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> was ſo confident, as to promiſe by the Meſſenger whome he ſent to me, that he would turne PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANT, if I would make good that my <hi>Aſſertion:</hi> To whome I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>I</hi> was ſure of a convert if the <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> would ſtand to his promiſe, and if he would come to my Studie, his eyes ſhould be judge, whether my <hi>Aſſertion</hi> were true by reading their own <hi>Authors.</hi> Some dayes after the <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> came to me, not to have the truth of his former challeng examined, but with a <hi>New provocation</hi> to me, and to my <hi>Colegue Maſter</hi> MELDRVM who then was with me, to debate at his <hi>Lodging</hi> with a <hi>Catholick ſcholer,</hi> (as his phraſe was,) concerning the truth of the <hi>Religion of</hi> PROTESTANTS. We told him, we knew how conferences of that nature had been miſrepreſented by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and therefore to obviat ſuch miſrepreſentations, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended with him upon ſome <hi>Conditions of the meeting,</hi> which you know were violated by your <hi>Party.</hi> When we came, after we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated the violation of promiſe made to us, <hi>I</hi> told, <hi>I</hi> had received the <hi>Two foreſaid Challenges,</hi> and deſired you who there appeared as their <hi>Champion, Firſt</hi> to anſwere whether <hi>I</hi> had wronged your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in the forementioned <hi>Aſſertion</hi> concerning <hi>Repentance,</hi> and then we ſhould willingly diſput the point of <hi>Religion,</hi> not againſt you
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101081:97"/>onely, but againſt the whole <hi>Conclave of Rome,</hi> if they had been there preſent. To the <hi>First</hi> you refuſed to give an <hi>Anſwere;</hi> and as to the <hi>Second,</hi> you ſaid, <hi>You came onely to impugne the Religion of</hi> PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANTS, <hi>but not at all to anſwere arguments againſt your Romiſh Religion.</hi> But it was Replyed to you, that our <hi>Religion</hi> was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the truth of GOD, but alſo was eſtabliſhed by the Law of the Land, and therefore, we could not ſuffer it onely to be queſtioned in ſuch a publick way. But would you anſwere us <hi>Six arguments</hi> againſt <hi>Your Religion,</hi> we ſhould anſwere you other <hi>Six arguments</hi> againſt <hi>Ours.</hi> Or would you anſwere us <hi>Two,</hi> we ſhould anſwere you other <hi>Two.</hi> But you ſtifly denyed to anſwere at all, till at length by the importunity of your friends you were moved to condeſcend to anſwere. Yet as to the <hi>Matter of fact,</hi> Concerning the Doctrine of <hi>Repentance,</hi> you utterly refuſed to anſwere at al, unleſſe I would frame it in an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> againſt <hi>Your Religion.</hi> Wherefore to gaine time, and to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Gentle-Man,</hi> who had been my Accuſer, I framed an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in more general termes, concerning the <hi>Doctrine of Repentance,</hi> then I had ſpoken thereof in <hi>Pulpit,</hi> hoping to have had liberty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to propound <hi>Other arguments</hi> of more general concernment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Your Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The argument touching <hi>Repentance</hi> ran thus. <hi>The religion which teacheth that a man when he hath ſinned, is not bound preſently to repent, is impious. But the Popiſh religion teacheth that a man when he hath ſinned, is not bound preſently to repent, Ergo the Popiſh religion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.</hi> You admitted the <hi>Minor,</hi> and denyed the <hi>Major, That it was an impious religion, which ſo taught.</hi> Whereupon I tooke all the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to witneſſe, and in ſpecial the <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> who had been my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, that you admitted this to be the doctrine of the Romiſh Church, <hi>That a man who hath ſinned, is not bound preſently to repent.</hi> And conſequently, that I had ſpoken truth, when I affirmed from <hi>Pulpit,</hi> that many of <hi>Your Romiſh Doctors</hi> taught this. But now, you being aſhamed, that you ſhould have admitted ſuch a Doctrine, (which all ſober Perſons are ready to cry down as impious,) to be the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> you have devyſed this after-evaſion, to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101081:98"/>terme it a <hi>Problematick point.</hi> Whether it ought to be looked u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon as a probleme, I may ſpeake a little anone.</p>
               <p>Now let the Reader obſerve: This queſtion concerning Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, was onely moved by me to vindicat my ſelf from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of the <hi>Gentle-Man</hi> who had provoked me to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſput;</hi> hoping to have had occaſion for <hi>Other Arguments</hi> afterwards. And therefore, when you had admitted the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> that is was the doctrine of <hi>Your Romiſh Church,</hi> I would have left that argument, as having obtained all by it which I intended. Yea, I did propound the argument in larger termes then I had ſpoken of that matter in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> onely to extort an <hi>Anſwere</hi> from you. So that whether it be a <hi>Problematick point</hi> or not, you could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing from it, as to the ordinary ſtraine of our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeing you refuſed to ſpeake to it in theſe termes wherein we delivered it in <hi>Pulpit.</hi> Nay more whoever will terme this point a <hi>Probleme,</hi> yet you are not <hi>In bonâ fide</hi> to doe it, for you did ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and without limitation at the <hi>Conference</hi> admit the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> which did aſſert this to be the Doctrine of your Church. This I hope may ſuffice concerning the occaſion of the <hi>Conference,</hi> and the moving of that queſtion at it.</p>
               <p>I come now to conſider a little of the <hi>Point</hi> it ſelf, whether it ought to be reckoned as a <hi>Probleme,</hi> and whether it be eſpouſed by many of your <hi>Doctors,</hi> and how far it may be charged upon <hi>Your Church:</hi> In order to which I ſhall ſay but <hi>Two</hi> things.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, that this is ſurely the received Doctrine of many of your <hi>Chief Doctors</hi> in the <hi>Preſent Romiſh Church, That a man when he hath ſinned is not tyed by the command of GOD, preſently to repent.</hi> For clearing this I ſhall not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This doctrine is now commone to all Divines except it be one or two late Writers.</hi> Yea divers of the forecited Authors, and others of the like ſtampe have gone a greater length in this unhappie doctrine, then I charged upon you. For they not onely teach, <hi>That a ſinner is not bound to repent immediatly after his treſpaſſe,</hi> but alſo in many <hi>Remarkable eireumstances,</hi> when GOD ſeemes to be ſignally calling for <hi>Repentance.</hi> As <hi>First, That a man is not bound to repent, when he ſeriouſly cals his ſinne to remembrance.</hi> Nor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, When a grievous calamitie is upon him, or the Countrey he lives in.</hi> Nor <hi>Thirdly, on holy and feſtival dayes,</hi> all theſe and much more you will find in <hi>Vaſquez, Queſt.</hi> 86. <hi>dub.</hi> 6. For after the enumeration of theſe, and other weighty caſes at length, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorly concludes, <hi>That the precept of Repentance never obliges Per ſe,</hi> that is, but by Accident, <hi>Except in the article of death.</hi> Yea there are of your <hi>Doctors,</hi> who goe yet a further length, and <hi>Doe deny that a ſinner by divine precept is bound to repent at all, even in the article of Death,</hi> of which a little hereafter. What Chriſtian ears can heare of theſe things and not tingle? May not this ſuffice to juſtifie the truth of my <hi>Aſſertion in Pulpit, viz, That many of your chief Doctors mantaine, that a man is not bound immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath ſinned to repent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I adde in the next place, that your great Doctors ſeeme to lay more weight upon this point, then upon a meere <hi>Probleme,</hi> yea and that <hi>Your Church</hi> cannot cleare her innocencie as to this
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101081:99"/>matter. For your <hi>Cardinal de Lugo,</hi> ſpeaking of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the place forecited, calls it, <hi>Communem ſenſum omnium fidelium,</hi> The commone ſenſe of all Beleevers. Doe your Authors ſpeake ſo of meer <hi>Problems?</hi> Nay the chief argument whereby the forecited Authors confirme this there tenet, is, from the <hi>Univerſal practiſe of your Romiſh Church.</hi> Becauſe, ſayeth <hi>Lugo,</hi> no penitent <hi>De dilatione pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiae ſe unquam accuſat, nec ullus Confeſſarius de hoc paenitentem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogat:</hi> And he addes this reaſon, <hi>quia ſiz, nemo in praxi exiſtimat eſſe novam culpam actualem ex dilatione paenitentiae.</hi> Hereupon the ſame <hi>Cardinal</hi> concludes the contrary doctrine to be <hi>Injurious</hi> to your whole <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> both Paſtors, and People. Becauſe it charges them with no ſmal guiltyneſſe, ſeeing neither Delinquents in their <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> nor <hi>Confeſſors</hi> in their examinations take any notice of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of repentance.</hi> I ſhall give you the words of your <hi>Cardinal, Minus digne ſentiunt de Eccleſiae corpore cum velint ab univerſis Eccleſiae non ſelum ſubditis, ſed Prelatis ex ignorantia omitti debitum.</hi> And this was one ground, whereupon in the conference I did charge <hi>Your Romiſh Church</hi> with this doctrine, when you would not ſpeake to it under theſe reſtrictions, with which I had ſpoken of it in the Pulpit. And if herein I have treſpaſſed in charging it upon <hi>Your Church,</hi> you may ſee, that not ſo much I, as your great <hi>Cardinal</hi> is to blame for it, and other your <hi>Authors,</hi> whoſe chief argument to confirme this doctrine, is taken <hi>A praxi Eccleſia.</hi> If this be the judgement of <hi>Your Church,</hi> why give you it out for <hi>A Probleme?</hi> If it be not the judgement of <hi>Your Church,</hi> then how comes it that there is no notice taken of the delay of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in your <hi>Penitential court of Conſcience</hi> either by Prieſt or People as your great Authors doe teſtifye?

               <p>After your impertinent and calumnious <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> concerning the firſt occaſion of our <hi>Debate,</hi> and your <hi>Problematick points,</hi> (for my worke in all theſe eight Papers hath been, to follow a roving <hi>Vagrant</hi> from one impertinencie to another,) you claver to as little purpoſe concerning the ſenſe of holy Scripture. <hi>Before</hi> ſay you, <hi>that our Religion be proven from Scripture, it muſt be first proven that we</hi> PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS <hi>have the true ſenſe of Scripture.</hi> But <hi>Firſt,</hi> Ought you not remember that in this writen debate, you doe ſuſtaine the part of the <hi>Opponent?</hi> might it not therefore be better retorred upon you, thus. Before you prove that the PROTESTANTS have not the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, you ought firſt to prove that they have not the true ſenſe of Scripture? And may it not be a convinceing argument <hi>Ad Hominem</hi> againſt you, that PROTESTANTS have the true ſenſe of Scripture, and conſequently, the True Religion, ſeeing in all theſe <hi>Eight Papers,</hi> you who appeared as the <hi>Romiſh Champion,</hi> to diſprove the Religion of PROTESTANTS, have not been able to produce one <hi>Medium</hi> to prove the falſhood of their Religion, or of their ſenſe of holy Scripture. But it ſeems that you would willingly forget that you are the <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi> I wonder nothing, that you who turne the weighty points of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101081:101"/>the Law to <hi>Problems,</hi> ſhould make a <hi>Probleme</hi> of this matter of fact, how evident ſo ever it be. So miſerably have you diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Opponents</hi> office, that you may truely be aſhamed to owne it. But <hi>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly.</hi> Could I make fairer proffers to you then I have done; Have I not offered to diſput, whether PROTESTANTS have the True Religion, and the true ſenſe of Scripture, both by <hi>Intrinſick Arguments</hi> from the <hi>Series</hi> of the context of Scripture, from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel places, and the analogie of faith; as alſo, by a more <hi>Extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick teſt,</hi> namely, the conformity of Religion with the faith of the moſt Ancient Chriſtian Church? But as a perfect Coward, who diſtruſted your cauſe, you durſt adventure on neither of theſe. Nay, all your cavils which once you ſtarted againſt both theſe grounds, ſuch as a catalogue of neceſſaries, rules of interpretation of Scripture, &amp;c. I have ſo convinceingly confuted, that you have not dated once to mention them againe in this your laſt <hi>Paper.</hi> Yea <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Flave I not gone a further length, and though I was onely the <hi>Defendant,</hi> yet being out-wearied by your Cowardlyneſſe. Have I not demonſtrated that in ſundrie chief points of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, ſuch as the <hi>Perspicuity and perfection of Scripture, the fallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Popes and Councils, and in the matter of tranſubſtantiation,</hi> that the PROTESTANTS had the right and true ſenſe of Scripture, and that you <hi>Romanssts</hi> were in the treſpaſſe? But you as a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Doctor</hi> have one <hi>Catholicon,</hi> by which you coufute all that your Adverſarie objects, namely, by calling it a <hi>Digreſſion,</hi> for with that Reply, you have ſatisfied your ſelf throughout all your <hi>Papers.</hi> Onely as to the laſt <hi>Specimen</hi> which I gave you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> you think you come off with honour, by ſaying, <hi>That it ſavours of what I taught my Scholars this last year.</hi> Are not you a brave <hi>Champion</hi> indeed, who are as afraid of an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> that hath beene handled in the Schools, as you would be of a <hi>Crocodile?</hi> What ſport would your men have made, had our <hi>Whitaker, Iunius, Chamier, and Danaaus,</hi> declined to examine <hi>Bellarmins</hi> arguments, becauſe he had handled them before in that <hi>Colledge</hi> where he was <hi>Profeſſor?</hi> But whereas you ſay, <hi>That the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101081:101"/>Argument which I brought against your tranſubſtantiation, ſeems to have beene the ſumme of all that I taught in the School this laſt year,</hi> you ſhall know, that I have not been accuſtomed to ſuch lazineſs, as to drone whole years like you upon one <hi>Syllogiſme.</hi> As in theſe forementioned particulars, I have demonſtrated that PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS have the true ſenſe of Scripture, and not you, the ſame might be ſhowen in all the reſt of the points of controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and us, and hath beene abundantly done by our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. But to propoſe more <hi>Arguments</hi> to you, is but <hi>Margaritas porco projicere.</hi> For it would ſeeme you dare graple with none of them. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I muſt advertiſe you of a <hi>Radical error,</hi> which leades you into many more. For you ſeeme ſtill to ſuppoſe, that who ever are a true <hi>Church,</hi> muſt have one general ground, from which the truth of all the points of <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſuch a ſociety doe owne, may be demonſtrated, without an examination of particulars. And this, if I miſtake not, is your <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which leades you into all the reſt of your errors. And therefore you ſtill wave the examination of particulars, and call for ſuch a general ground. But in this you ſhow extreame baſeneſſe, that you neither prove the neceſſity of ſuch a <hi>Principle,</hi> nor yet produce that <hi>Principle,</hi> by which your and our Religion is to be examined.

And this may be ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <hi>Ad Hominem</hi> againſt you: For if there were any ſuch <hi>Commone Ground,</hi> it would be the <hi>Infallibility of your Propounders,</hi> but not this as I have proven in my former <hi>Papers.</hi> Nay, I have ſo ſoundly cudgelled this your <hi>Romiſh principle</hi> in my <hi>Laſt,</hi> that you

For if you meane by our having the true ſenſe of Scripture, that our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is contained in Scripture, as the true ſenſe thereof intended by the holy Ghoſt; then if we muſt prove, that we have the true ſenſe of Scripture, before we prove that we have the True Religion, we muſt prove we have the true Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before we prove that we have the true Religion: A noble ſtick of <hi>Romiſh non-ſenſe. Sixthly,</hi> how eaſie were it to demonſtrate againſt you <hi>Romanists,</hi> that we PROTESTANTS have the true ſenſe of Scripture, ſeeing in moſt of all the <hi>Poſitives</hi> of our Religion, you doe agree with us; as, that there is a GOD, that he is to be adored, and that there are three Perſons, &amp;c. Conſequently, The PROTESTANTS ſenſe of Scripture muſt be the true ſenſe, elſe your Religion cannot be true. You muſt either acknowledge that vve have the true ſenſe of Scripture, or condemne your ovvn Religion. The chief controverſie that remaines betvvixt you and us, is, concerning your <hi>Supernumerarie Additions,</hi> as, vvhether not onely GOD is to be adored, but alſo <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>Croſſes,</hi> and not onely GOD is to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated, but alſo <hi>Saincts,</hi> and <hi>Angels, &amp;c.</hi> That is, vvhether there be ſo many more <hi>Supernumerarie ſenſes</hi> of Scripture, beſides thoſe vvhich PROTESTANTS mantaine, and you <hi>Papiſts</hi> dare not deny: Whether I ſay, beſides theſe, there be other ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ought not you then to prove theſe your <hi>Supernumerarie ſenſes?</hi> And are not vve ſufficiently vvarranted to adhere to the <hi>Negative,</hi> except there be ſolid grounds for theſe <hi>Superadded ſexſes,</hi> vvhich I beleeve, neither you, nor the vvhole ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101081:102"/>of all <hi>Lucifers Acumen.</hi> But <hi>Seventhly</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> Seeing nothing will ſatisfie you, unleſſe I, though onely the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> doe alſo prove againſt you the <hi>Negative,</hi> that is, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Our ſenſe</hi> of Scripture is true, but alſo, that theſe <hi>Your ſuperadded and ſupernumerarie ſenſes</hi> are not true; therefore, to draw you, if it be poſſible our of your lurking holes, I will try you by this <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The ſenſe of Scripture given by your preſent <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> in many things contradicts the ſenſe given by the <hi>Ancient Romiſh Church, Ergo,</hi> the ſenſe put upon Scripture by your <hi>Preſent Romiſh Church,</hi> in many things cannot be true. The <hi>Sequel</hi> is cleare, becauſe two contradictories cannot be true. If therefore, you confeſſe that the <hi>Ancient Romiſh Church</hi> had the true ſenſe of Scripture, which ye muſt doe, or elſe deſtroy the great foundation of your Religion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all ages, then wherein you contradict the <hi>Ancient Romiſh Church,</hi> therein ſurely you deviat from the true ſenſe of Scripture.

But hitherto, in ſo many Papers, all that can be extorted out of you, is, that your <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Religion is proven to be a true Religion, be this <hi>Medium,</hi> becauſe it is grounded upon the word of GOD, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the true ſerſe of the letter of Scripture, a reaſon indeed moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and convincent, if it were true. But this pretended conformity of <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Religion with Scripture, was ſhowen this way to you, to be a meer imaginar and groundleſſe conformity, becauſe, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, a thing to be conforme to a true ſenſe, except it be ſupponed to be a true ſenſe ſo it is impoſſible that a thing can be proven to be conforme to a true ſenſe, except it be firſt ſhowen and proven that there is a true ſenſe: Ergo, you cannot prove your Religion to be true, becauſe it is conforme to the true ſerſe of the letter of Scripture, except firſt you bring ſome pregnant reaſon, whereby the underſtandings of men may be convinced, that you have upon your ſide the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture. Now, ſince all dependes upon this one point, you were deſired to apply your ſelf wholly to ſatisfie this onely, and to doe in a ſubſtantious and ſchool way, laying aſide for a whyle your diffuſe, railing Pulpit way. But let us now examine the noble anſweres that you give in this your laſt Paper.</p>
               <p>The firſt anſwere is not direct, but rather a declining of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, under pretext that it makes a <hi>Non-ſeſe,</hi> to ſay, <hi>That before a Religion can be ſhowen or proven to be true, it muſt firſt be proven, that there is the true ſeate of the letter of Scripture upon their part who profeſſes ſuch a Religion, becauſe the true ſenſe of the letter of Scripture, and the truth of Religion, are one and the ſelf ſame thing, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For if you meane, by our having the true ſenſe of Scripture, that our Religion is contained in Scripture, as the true ſenſe thereof intended by the holy Ghoſt, then if we must prove that we have the true ſenſe of Scripture, before we prove that we have the True Religion, we muſt prove that we have the True Religion, before we prove that we have the True Religion.</hi> Theſe were my words, and if the inference be not ſolid upon the Suppoſition
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101081:113"/>laid downe therein, theſe who have common ſenſe may judge. Yet to this you have made <hi>Three Replyes,</hi> but each of them more ludibrious then another.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>First Reply,</hi> is a pedantick whifle about formall <hi>Praeciſions;</hi> you ſay. <hi>That I ſhew my ſelf to be altogether ignorant of the nature of formall praeciſions, which have vertue, where they interverne to make a ſufficent diſtinction betwixt the Medium and the Probleme.</hi> For all your pretended skil of theſe <hi>Praciſions,</hi> there are ſchoole.

Yet I confeſſe in ſome ſenſe, you may commence <hi>Doctor</hi> in the matter of <hi>Praeciſions;</hi> For you have a notable faculty of praeſcinding from the purpoſe.

That our Religion is contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the true ſenſe thereof intended by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And this, <hi>That our Religion is the true Religion.</hi> Can you either conceive or conclude, that our Religion is contained in the Scripture, as the true ſenſe thereof intended by the holy Ghoſt, and not conceive <hi>Ipſo Facto,</hi> and <hi>Formaliter,</hi> that it is the True Religion? Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeeing from the beginning of your <hi>Papers</hi> you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. <hi>That a Religion to be a True Religion, and to be conforms to the true ſenſe of Scripture are Synonima's.</hi> You may try in the next how you can prove this, for you ſtill leave the greateſt part of your worke behind you. But in the <hi>Second place</hi> from this pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick notion, you proceed to a more abſurd poſition, as if heere <hi>There were an objective diſtinction betwixt the Medium and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme,</hi> ſtill out of your Modeſtie, <hi>

But <hi>Secondly,</hi> what ignorance and abſurdity doe you bewray, when you ſay, <hi>That all the truths contained under the letter of Scripture may be, and yet make up no Religion at all.</hi> I will inſtance to you a few Scripture truths, which it is impoſſible they ſhould be, and not make up a Religion. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. <hi>It is written, thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and Him only ſhalt thou ſerve. John</hi> 20.31. <hi>Theſe thinges are written, that ye might beleeve that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, ye might have life through his name.</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his commandement, that ye ſhould beleeve on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe Scripture truths cannot be, unleſſe they concurre to make up a Religion; and the reaſon is evident, which alſo deſtroyes your fond <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> and pretended reaſon to the contratie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they include in them a <hi>Form all obligation</hi> of worſhiping GOD, and beleeving in order to the obtaining or Salvation. Do not you the refore bewray brutiſh ignorance of Scripture, and of Religion when you ſay, <hi>That all truths contained in the Scripture may be without an obligation to beleeve them, and ſo compound no Religion at all.</hi> For it is one <hi>Scripture Truth,</hi> that we are commanded, and obliged in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to beleeve theſe truths, in order to the obtaining of Salvation. Your <hi>Third Reply</hi> is nothing leſſe ludibrious then the former <hi>Two,</hi> in which you ſay, <hi>That what was ſaid in that anſwere of mire to you, may be ſaid by perſons of another Religion, alſwell as by us,</hi> And who doubts but <hi>Hereticks</hi> may juſtly repell your <hi>Noneſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But you have another trifling <hi>Shift, Before</hi> (ſay you,) <hi>That confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the faith of the Ancient (hurch, in the firſt three Centuries, be admitted as a Teſt, by which the truth of Religion may be diſcerned, it ought to be proven, that all the neceſſaries of the Chriſtian Religion,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101081:116"/>are contained in their writings, which are now extant.</hi> But <hi>Firſt,</hi> may it not with better reaſon be reſorted on you, that before you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it from being a <hi>Teſt,</hi> you ought firſt to have proven, that there were ſome neceſſaries, and eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion no where to be found in any of the writings of theſe three ages? If any be wanting, produce them, and your evidence of their abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity? If you can produce no neceſſarie article that is wanting, why decline you the tryal? But the truth is, you <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch a deſperat cauſe, that if either <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity</hi> be Umpyre, you muſt ſurely be condemned. There is no way to get a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable <hi>Interloquitur</hi> for you, but by ſetting up your <hi>Infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders,</hi> that is, your own ſelves, to be <hi>Supreame judges</hi> to the whole World. If ſuch a Religion be not to be ſuſpected, let the World judge. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> doe not you Romaniſts boaſt bigly ſometimes of <hi>Univerſal traditions?</hi> And here by the way, I tel you, I ſhall never declyne to have all the <hi>Eſſentials of Religion</hi> tryed by the famous rule of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis, in Commonitorio primo, contra Haereſes, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>Quod ubique, quod ſemper, quod ab omnibus eſt creditum.</hi> But if any of the neceſſaries, or eſſentials of Chriſtianity, are not to be found in the writings of the <hi>Three first Centuries,</hi> how ſhall we have a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and univerſal tradition</hi> for theſe, ſeeing the current is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be broken off at the fountain, for three hundred yeares there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?

We muſt examine her <hi>Credentials,</hi> before we become ſo implicite to her, in matters of <hi>Fact.</hi> But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If any of the <hi>Neceſſaries of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> be altogether wanting in the writings of Ancients of theſe ages, how did your <hi>Gualterius the Jeſuit</hi> undertake to prove the truth of your Religion, by the teſtimonies of the Church in all ages? It is true, he was moſt unhappie in his undertaking, in ſo much that <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> in his <hi>Defence of Doctor Potter part.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. §. 119. affirmes that he heard an able man of your Religion ſay, <hi>That Gualterius had not produced one pertinet teſtimony in the firſt three Centuries.</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:101081:117"/>The like may be ſaid of <hi>Ioannes Andreas Coppenſtenius a Predicant,</hi> in his <hi>Historical ſupplement to Bellarmine,</hi> who undertakes the like, but with as little ſucceſſe.

He knowes upon tryal he muſt be condemned. I have preſſed you to come to be examined either by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or both, or to produce any other ſolid way, of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true Religion from a falſe, but you declyne all.

                  </gap>nd ſimple People, you will cary it out by a Bastard ſort of eloquence, that is, by a multitude of words, that either wants a ſufficient ſignification corresponding to them, or elſe, are about objects
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101081:120"/>altogether diſparat and out of line. You carp at that which I ſaid, that the cauſe wherefore I did not anſwere to all things contained in your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, was not the prolixity of them, but barrenneſſe and ſuperfluity of them. This you ſay is a contradiction, for if they be barren, how are they ſuperfluous? But I tell you over againe, that there is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in affirming your Papers, to be both barren of stuffe that makes to the purpoſe, or to our preſent controverſie, and ſtuffed with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous digreſſions out of purpoſe. And with this occaſion I call to your minde other ſort of <hi>Contradictions</hi> upon your part. For when you was urged to give ſome ground whereby might be proven the truth of the <hi>PROTESTANT Religion.</hi> Your anſwere was, that Religion is not an indiviſible truth, but a complex of many, and ſo, that ye were not obliged to prove in generall the truths of your Religion, but that you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to all the particulars, and to this effect, you brought an example of a purſe, holding an hundred pieces of gold in it, which muſt be all applyed to the touch ſtone, one be one. But afterwards, when you aſſigning for the ground of the truth of your Religion, the perspicuity of Scripture in all particular points that you hold as neceſſary to ſalvation, you were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to give a list of all theſe particular points, that ſo they might be tryed, whether the perspicuity of Scripture did ſhyne brightly over them all, here you diſclaimed your former example of the purſe, alleaging that you was not obliged to deſcend to particulars. Is not this to breath out of the ſame mouth, both heat and cold? Likewiſe you are alwayes pretending, that you are a meer <hi>Defendant</hi> and not <hi>Opugnant,</hi> and yet your <hi>Papers</hi> containes almost nothing elſe but <hi>Impugnations of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick doctrines,</hi> which make nothing to our preſent controverſie. Neither will it avail to ſay, that the Defendant may <hi>Retort arguments,</hi> becauſe the retortion of arguments in our preſent controverſie, doth only ſerve to condemne your own Religion, of falſhood and error; For giving and not granting, that you had all the grounds for the truth of your Religion, which Catholicks have for the truth of theirs, (though it be most falſe,) and that this is all that you pretend by your retortions, yet it cannot ſerve to prove the truth of your Religion, becauſe, you violently putting out the Catholick Religion, under pretext that it was
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101081:121"/>falſe and erronious, were obliged to bring in another which was better &amp; conſequently that had better grounds. And if you did proceed reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, this only were ſufficient to cloſe your mouth, and to make you lay aſide all ſuch ſuperfluous digreſſions, and to inſiſt only in bringing ſuch ſolid reaſons, that could not be applyed to any Religion that you esteeme to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e erronious.</p>
               <p>I purpoſly omit as I have profeſſed alwayes to doe all your digreſſions that maks nothing to our preſent purpoſe. As that miſapplyed diſcourſe of <hi>Sainct Chryſoſtome</hi> with the <hi>Pagans,</hi> ſince juſt as it lyes, and as it is cited by you, it may be aſſumed by any new <hi>Upſtart Sectarie</hi> if they were cited before your aſſembly, &amp; asked in what Scripture he did found his error. And though you call it a triſling cavill, to object ſo often to you, that all you bring to prove the truth of the <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may be with as great reaſone aſſumed to prove a falſe Religion to be true, yet you muſt know that is no triſling matter, but a maine point, and an argument both of the weakenes of your Religion, and of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency to mantaine it, for ſince you can bring nothing that is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to diſtinguiſh your Religion from a falſe religion, it remaines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in that ſtate as hath been often told you, that a man is in, who is affirmed indeed to be an honest man, but ſuch an honest man that there is no difference betwixt him and a knave. Likewiſe I omit here that long diſcourſe whereby you diſclaime <hi>Calvine</hi> as the author of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and claimes to <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> at last to be upon your ſide, though the world knowes, that they<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Good Sir leaving all your <hi>Paterga's,</hi> remember that the occaſion of this debate, was your continual railing in <hi>Pulpit</hi> againſt <hi>Catholick</hi> Dectrines, and being deſired to give ſome good ſolid ground, for the truth of your own religion, whereby both your own might be confirmed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101081:121"/>and others induced to imbrace it. You did very ſtoutly undertake the buſſines, &amp; did bragingly proteſt that ye would mantaine the truth of the <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Religion againſt whomſoever, before whomeſoever, or in whatſoever place or time, but when it came to the purpoſe and you were deſired to produce your grounds and reaſons, whereby it might be mantained to be a true religion. Your first refuge was, that you as the <hi>Defendant,</hi> was not obliged to produce any ground, but all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then incumbed on me as the <hi>Opponent,</hi> to prove that you had no grounds. And in this, you behaved your ſelf juſt as if one ſhould come as ſent from the <hi>Council,</hi> to impone upon the <hi>L. Proveſt and venerable Councill of Aberdene,</hi> a charge to apprehend a perſone as ſuſpect of Diſloyalty to his <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>L. Proveſt,</hi> deſiring to ſee his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> he ſhould reply, that he was not obliged to ſhow his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> but that the <hi>Proveſt</hi> would prove that he had no <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> and that his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> was ſufficiently proven by this that there could not be produced reaſons to ſhow that he had no commiſſion. So you have undertaken to mantain the truth of the <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and being demanded, that you ſhow your grounds, whereby the truth of it may be mantained, you reply, that you are not obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce grounds, but that another ſhould prove that you have no grounds, not conſidering that religion is a poſitive thing, and a complex of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive dogm's: and ſo cannot be mantained to be true, but by producing of poſitive grounds, and the ſhifting to produce them, will make all to give ſentence, that it is deſtitute of ſolid grounds.</p>
               <p>Your next refuge was, that your Religion was proven to be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was conforme to Scripture, that is to ſay, to the true ſenſe of the letter of Seripture. Now this pretended conformity, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be meerly imaginary and groundleſſe, becauſe, as it is impoſſible that a thing can be conforme to a true ſenſe, except it be ſupponed that there is exiſtent a true ſenſe: ſo it is impoſſible that a thing can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be conforme to a true ſenſe, exceept it be proven that there is a true ſenſe. Now you were deſired to lay aſide your diffuſed <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit</hi> railing ſtyle, and by a judicious and ſchool way, to produce ſome ſoild ground, whereby mens underſtanding might be convinced, that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101081:122"/>
                  <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Religion hath the true ſenſe of the letter by the holy Ghoſt, of the letter of Scripture. To this you anſwered, firſt, that it makes a Non-ſenſe, to ſay, that a Religion cannot be proven to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the true ſenſe of the letter of ſcripture, except it be proven that there is a true ſenſe. Now I ask you, where lyes here a nonſerſe, or point me out any thing here that is not moſt cleare? Indeed you, in place of this my propoſition, did ſubſtitute one of your own, and with your own words, and I willingly grant to you, that yours makes a Non-ſenſe. Next, you ſeeme to chaſſe, becauſe I taxt your diſcourſe to be founded upon groſſe ignorance, both about the nature of <hi>Formall Preciſions,</hi> and about the nature of <hi>True Religion;</hi> and to this you reply firſt, that to speake to you of <hi>Formall Preciſions</hi> is a <hi>Pedantick</hi> thing. But is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that you who profeſſeth your ſelf to be a Divine, ſhould ſo ſlight <hi>Preciſions,</hi> ſince they are the very quinteſſence of all ſuperiour ſciences, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> might teach you, that there is no ſcience of particulars, but in ſo far, as the are reduced to ſome commone abſtraction or <hi>Preciſion,</hi> and that every ſcience hath his own particular abſtraction, whereby it is both conſtitute and distinguiſhed from all other ſciences. Next, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to your School-Boyes, who will teach me the nature of <hi>Formall Preciſions.</hi> I am glade that Scholers are ſo learned, but if it be ſo, they out-ſhut their Maſter, and knowes more nor their Maſter, at leaſt ſhowes to know; as appeares in this ſame anſwere that you make here, For I telling you, <hi>That the objective grounds of preciſions, is ſeparabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that this is to be ſound betwixt truths revealed in Scripture, and True Religion, and that on both parts; becauſe True Religion is ſeparable from conformity with Scripture,</hi> Since there was true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the World, before there was any Scripture writen: And on the other part, <hi>All the truths revealed in Scripture, might be, though they componed no Religion,</hi> to wit, <hi>If GOD had ſo revealed them, that he had not impoſed an Obligation upon us to beleeve them,</hi> as he might have done, or wherefore might he not have done it? Now to impugne this, you bring texts of Scripture, to prove that <hi>De Facto,</hi> this obligation to beleeve is not ſeperat. I ſpeake of <hi>Separability,</hi> and what GOD might have done, and you argue againſt <hi>Actuall ſeparation,</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:101081:122"/>as if I had ſaid, that <hi>De Facto,</hi> there is no obligation to beleeve things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture. Are you not aſhamed of ſuch ignorant miſtaking? Or, were not well applyed to you, thoſe civill termes that your ſelf uſe in this Paper, to wit, that you behoved to be drunke, or dreaming when thir things eſcaped your penne? Likewiſe how groſſe miſtaking is it, to ſay, <hi>That I granted, that a Religion to be true, and to be conforme to Scripture are Synonima's;</hi> whereas I ſaid only this <hi>Ad Hominem,</hi> and to argue you out of your own principles, who admits no rule of divine truth, but the writen word. And in this you imitat many other of your Champions, who as I told you elſe where, did cite for poſitive doctrine of Fathers and Scholasticks the objections they made againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond anſwere is, that the ſenſe which you give to the letter of Scripture, is proven to be a true ſenſe, becauſe it coincids with the ſenſe that the fathers gives. And you are to be praiſed, for the recanting of your former confining of this to the Fathers of the firſt three Centuries, but withall, you ſhould have ſhowne, how farre, and to how many more ages you doe now extend your former confining. And who would not ſmyle to hear you recur to the Fathers, who takes all authority from them, holding them for men as obnoxious to errors as your ſelves are? And when you are preſſed with their authorities against you, you run back to Scripture alone, ſaying, that you will admit them only in ſo farre as they agree to ſcripture, that is to ſay, to the arbitrarie gloſſes that you give to the letter of Scripture.</p>
               <p>At length you have taken a compendious way to end all Controverſie, and to take away all doubt concerning the truth of your Religion, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this offer: that you will be content to diſclaime <hi>PROTESTANT</hi> Religion, if there can be brought any one article of it, which you will not ſhow to be contained either clearlie and in termes in ſome place of Scripture, or elſe by a ſolid conſequence, that it is deduceable out of veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties clearlie &amp; in termes revealed in Scripture. This is your offer, and I hope you meane that faling, you will make this recantation publicklie and with ſome ſolemnitie. Now I out of the love, I carrie to this your converſion, accepts your offer, and not to burthen you with manie things,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101081:123"/>I propone for the preſent this one article, whereby you hold that there are onely <hi>Two Sacraments,</hi> deſiring you to aſſigne either a place of Scripture, where this is clearly and in termes revealed, or aſſigne ſome verity clearly and in termes revealed, out of the which this article by a ſolid conſequence may be deduced. But remember, that the queſtion is not, <hi>Whether there be two Sacraments, but all the queſtion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this excluſive particle, only two Sacraments.</hi> Likwiſe be pleaſed to remember, that the deductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt beſolid, according to your own word that you uſe, and it is not ſufficiently proven to be ſolid, becauſe you call it ſolid, or, becauſe you ſay, it will appeare ſolid to all thoſe, <hi>Whoſe eyes the God of this World hath not blinded,</hi> which is your ordinar expreſſion in ſuch like matters.</p>

               <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhew from <hi>Chryſostome,</hi> that your <hi>Objection concerning the ſenſe of holy Scripture</hi> (which hath been the ſubſtance of your two former Papers,) was an old rotten <hi>Cavil of Heathens</hi> againſt the Chriſtian Religion; and that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> of old did anſwere thereunto, as we PROTESTANTS doe now a dayes to you <hi>Jeſuits.</hi> But this you ſay, <hi>You purpoſlie omit as a Digreſſion, making nothing to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe.</hi> Is it nothing to our preſent purpoſe, that you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to object againſt our Religion, but <hi>Heathniſh cavils</hi> againſt the Chriſtian Religion? Is it nothing to the purpoſe, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> anſwered theſe Cavils, as we PROTESTANTS doe you <hi>Jeſuits?</hi> Doeth not this demonſtrat a conſonancy betwixt <hi>Our Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Old Chriſtian Religion;</hi> betwixt our principles, and the principles of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and conſequently of other <hi>Ancient Fathers?</hi> But to ſalve this your abſurd omiſſion, you exerciſe your calumniating veine, ſaying, <hi>That I miſapply Chrſoſtome, and what I cite from him may be aſſumed by any Sectarie.</hi> Is it enough for you to ſay that I miſapplyed him? Ought you not to have diſcovered my Treſpaſſe? Did I not give you the <hi>Formalia verba</hi> of the Father? Should I regard your revileings, who ſpare not to ſay, that <hi>Chryſoſlomes</hi> anſwere to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes Objection</hi> may be aſſumed by any <hi>Sectarie?</hi> Is not this an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> were he alive to day, ſhould be a <hi>Sectarie</hi> with you, and of the Religion of PROTESTANTS? But <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe you ſtill clamoured (though without cauſe,) <hi>That there is no aſſignable ground of the conformity of the Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

One argument was propoſed in a Syllogiſticke frame, the <hi>Medium</hi> whereof was, that the Religion of PROTESTANTS had all the ſolid grounds which the True Chriſtian Religion hath. The other <hi>Argument</hi> was drawn up by way of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:101081:124"/>or in our <hi>Negatives,</hi> but in neither, as I did demonſtrate. Yet neither of theſe <hi>Arguments</hi> doe you once touch. Had you intended a Paper correſpondent to your <hi>Inſcription, To prove the conformity of our Religion with ſcripture to be imaginary, &amp; groundles,</hi> ought you not to have examined and diſcuſſed theſe <hi>Arguments?</hi> How would your men laugh at one who would ſet down a magnificke title, promiſing a confutation of all <hi>Bellarmins arguments,</hi> and yet in the body of the diſcourſe, touch none of them? Is the ſtrength of imagination ſo ſtrong with you, as to imagine, that you have proven the conformity of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion with Scripture to be imaginarie and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, when you dare not once touch the Arguments which are brought to prove the conformity of the PROTESTANT Religion with the Scriptures to be reall? Have you not need to be ſent to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> School, to be taught to be mute, untill you learne to ſpeake to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I did not only prove, that the Religion of PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANTS had grounds to prove its conformity with the Scriptures, but alſo, to ſtop the mouth of a Caviller, I declared to you what was that ground, and I tooke it from <hi>Georgius Scholarius,</hi> his <hi>Third Oration</hi> in the <hi>Councill</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and did appeale thereunto for the deciſion of all controverſies betwixt us and you. But you never once touched this ground. How then could you imagine, that you had confuted the conformity of the Religion of PROTESTANTS with Scripture? Doeth the Devil abuſe the imaginations of <hi>Jeſuited He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> as ſomeſay, that he doeth the fancy's of <hi>Witches,</hi> making them imagine that they doe the thing of which they only dreamed? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> did I not give a <hi>Direct Anſwere</hi> to your <hi>Objection</hi> by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall diſtinction? If any thing ſhould have been taken notice of, ought not this? Yet ye wholly overleap it. A goodly <hi>Diſpistant</hi> indeed. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I refuted ſome new Cavils, which you ſtarted to prove, <hi>That the truth of Religion, ought not to be tryed by its conformity with the faith of the Ancient Church, in the firſt three Centuries.</hi> But you found my <hi>Replyes</hi> thereto ſo thornie, that you have not dared to meddle with them. Only you have an impudent <hi>Calumny</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that matter, which I may afterwards touch. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101081:125"/>as you had accuſed <hi>Calvine,</hi> and our <hi>Reformers,</hi> as contemners of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> I ſhew not only, that <hi>Calvine</hi> had confuted your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but alſo, that <hi>Antiquity</hi> is more contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by you <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> then ever it was by the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi> I brought many Inſtances hereof from <hi>Bellarmine, Maldonate, Melchior Canus, Briſacerius,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Muſſus,</hi> but all theſe you ſmother in ſilence. Thus have I given an overly touch of ſome few of your <hi>Omiſſions.</hi> Whoſo will be at paines to compare my ninth Paper with your Tenth, will find you guilty of many more. Only now let me ask, are theſe the <hi>Digreſſions,</hi> the <hi>Parer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga's,</hi> and the <hi>Superfluities</hi> which you talk of in my Paper? Doe not every one of thoſe touch the <hi>Cauſe?</hi> Have they not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine riſe from <hi>Your Papers?</hi> Who that regarded either truth, or his own reputation, would have overleaped all thoſe? You have made great haſte to tranſmit your Papers to me, but you have ſtill left your worke behinde you.

Now only I tell you, that if you have the confidence to try the truth or falſhood of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>By the conſonancie thereof with or diſſonancie to the faith of the Catholick Chruch in the firſt three Centuries,</hi> you ſhall find that I never intended ſo to aſtrict my ſelf to theſe ages, as not to goe further. After we have gotten the verdict of the <hi>Firſt three Centuries,</hi> I ſhall not then declyne to trace you ſucceſſively through all ſucceeding ages to this day. And I am confident upon a through diſcuſſe it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that <hi>Your preſent Romiſh Faith,</hi> as to all its <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> was never the faith of the <hi>Catholick Church in anie age,</hi> let be in <hi>All.</hi> And upon the conttarie, neither you, nor any of your Adherents ſhall be able to prove, that our Religion differs in <hi>Its Eſſentials,</hi> from the faith of the <hi>Catholick Church in anie age.</hi> Now in ſuch an enquiry, can we fall upon a more convenient Method, then to beginne at the fountain, I meane at the moſt pure, Ancient and (according to <hi>Egeſippus Elogie,</hi>) Virgin Church, in the <hi>Firſt three Centuries.</hi> If our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thereto in all <hi>Its Eſſentials</hi> (as I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident it ſhall) then ſure it is conforme to the True <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> in all ages. If yours be
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101081:126"/>found diſſonant thereto (as I doubt not but it will,) then ſure it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Chriſtian Religion, in all ages. <hi>For there is but one faith, Eph.</hi> 4.5. and one True Religion.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> you have the boldneſſe to upbraid me with <hi>Two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions.</hi> Only before I propoſe them, I muſt minde you, that neither of theſe pretended <hi>Contradictions</hi> are in my <hi>Ninth Paper,</hi> to which you now anſwere.

               </p>
               <p>The firſt alledged contradiction is, <hi>That upon the one hand, I ſhould have affirmed Religion to be a complex of many truths, which are to be ſeverally tryed, as the ſeverall pieces of gold in a purſe, and that I would deſcend to the ſeverall particulars, yea, and that all points neceſſary to ſalvation, were contained perſpicuouſly in Scripture: Yet when you called me, to give a list of all theſe particular points, then I diſclaimed my former example of a purſe, and alledged that I was not obliged to deſcend to particulars.</hi> I ſee now I was in no miſtake, when I ſaid, that you walked by that <hi>Machiavillian principle, Calumniare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacter &amp;c.</hi> Reſume all my Papers, and ſee if ever I refuſed to deſcend to a tryall of any particular <hi>Controverſie</hi> betwixt you and us?

                  </gap> that once I gave you under my hand? But I ſhall ingenuouſſy tell the truth of that which you ſo deceitfully miſrepreſent, and when I have done, contradict me if you can.

                  <hi>I</hi> come now to take ſome notice, how you behave your ſelf, in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101081:128"/>vindicating your poor cavill, <hi>Concerning the ſenſe of Scripture.</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me therefore to lay before you ſome <hi>Instances</hi> of your weakeneſs herein. As <hi>Firſt, You now acknowledge, that in the ſenſe wherein I propoſed your objection in my nynth Paper, it is perfect Non-ſenſe.</hi> But in my <hi>Ninth Paper, I</hi> gave no other ſenſe of it, then <hi>I</hi> had given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my <hi>Eight Paper.</hi> Nay in my Ninth Paper, <hi>I</hi> did repeat <hi>In terminis</hi> what <hi>I</hi> had ſaid in my Eight, to make you ſenſible of your ludibrious whifle, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning <hi>Formal preciſions:</hi> But notwithſtanding the <hi>ſenſe</hi> which <hi>I</hi> had given of <hi>your objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in my <hi>eight paper,</hi> you mantain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be <hi>Good ſenſe,</hi> &amp; that ther interveened a ſufficient diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Medium</hi> &amp; the <hi>Problem;</hi> But now without any variatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſince it is become perfect <hi>Nonſenſe,</hi> according to your own acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If this be your skill of <hi>Formal preciſions,</hi> wherein you glory, to turne <hi>Senſe</hi> to <hi>Non-ſenſe,</hi> neither I, nor others, will much-envy your <hi>Acumen. Secondly</hi> therefore, to make ſome ſenſe of this your cavil, you exhibit it thus to us, <hi>A Religion cannot be proven to be conforme to the true ſenſe of the letter of ſcripture, except it be firſt proven that there is a true ſenſe.</hi> And you cry out, <hi>Where lyes there any non-ſenſe here? And you call on us to point you out any thing which is not cleare.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> doe yet deſiderat both clearneſs and truth in this your <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> as it is now propoſed by you. <hi>I</hi> ſay <hi>Firſt, I</hi> deſiderat Clearneſs, for hereby you would ſeeme to queſtion, <hi>Whether ſcripture had a true ſenſe?</hi> As if the GOD of Truth could not ſpeake <hi>Senſe,</hi> or had delyvered <hi>Non-ſenſe</hi> in the holy Scriptures. Yet <hi>I</hi> have more charitie to you, then to thinke that you are come to that height of prophane <hi>Scepticiſme.</hi> This only <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, to ſhow that the <hi>Senſe</hi> of your words appeares not ſo cleare; and that they might ſuffer ſuch a <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But <hi>I</hi> am apt to conceive, that the thing which you would have ſaid, was, <hi>That before we</hi> PROTESTANTS <hi>prove our Religion to be conforme to the ſcriptures, it must be proven, that the ſenſe which we give of ſcripture is true.</hi> But, (beſides all which hath been ſaid in my two former Papers to this, moſt of which to this houre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines unanſwered,) <hi>I</hi> now ſay, that <hi>I</hi> deſiderat the <hi>Truth of this, Aſſertion,</hi> even as thus expreſſed. For a <hi>Propoſition</hi> may be ſo ſuculent,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:101081:129"/>that the words being underſtood, the underſtanding, if it be ſound, cannot but preſently take up the ſenſe thereof without any antecedent proofe: Elſe in proving the true ſenſe of any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> we ſhould runne <hi>In infinitum.</hi> And therefore, that a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may be proven to be conforme to the ſenſe of the letter of the Scripture, it is only requiſite, that the ſenſe of the letter of Scripture be either in it ſelf luculent, obvious and clear, the words being once underſtood; or if it be not ſo obvious and clear, that in that caſe, it be proven. This I freely grant, and ſhall never decline in the handling of any controverted point with you. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in ſtead of proving that there doth interveen a <hi>Formal preciſion,</hi> ſufficient to make a diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Medium</hi> and the <hi>Probleme</hi> in your <hi>Propoſition,</hi> as it was gloſſed upon by me in my <hi>Eight Paper,</hi> which was the thing incumbent to you, you only fall out upon a commendation of <hi>Formal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions,</hi> together with ſome ſcoffing jeeres againſt me and my Scholars, which diſcover more of your follie, then injure either of us. I meddle not with ſuch excentrick foolries. Neither doe I deny, but Divines may make uſe of Preciſions as occaſion ſerves. But to turne ſo grave a <hi>Theologick debate</hi> into a <hi>Logical ſcuffle,</hi> about <hi>Formal preciſions,</hi> ſavoures at beſt, but of a <hi>Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick spirit:</hi> Eſpecially, when it appeares that it is brought in only to cloacke that which now you confeſſe to be a <hi>Non-ſenſe. Fourthly,</hi> after this whifle about <hi>Formal Preciſions,</hi> you bewray groſſe inadvertencie, about your <hi>Objective preciſions, and ſeparability betwixt all the truths contained in ſcripture and true Religion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> ſay you, <hi>all the truths in Scripture might have been revealed, and no obligation laid upon us to believe them.</hi> And in this you blame me, <hi>That I only proved by the Scripture-inſtances which I brought that there is no actuall ſeparation betwixt all the truths contained in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the true Religion, but did not prove them inſenarable.</hi> But if you looke againe to my Paper, you will find that your inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie is onely to be blamed. For I did prove the <hi>abſolute inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</hi> betwixt all the truths contained in Scripture and the true
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:101081:129"/>Religion. Which againe I thus demonſtrate, according to the grounds laid downe in my <hi>Laſt.</hi> If all the truths in Scripture cannot be without an obligation to believe them, in order to the obtaining of Salvation, then <hi>All the truths of Scripture</hi> cannot be, except they compound a <hi>Religion.</hi> But the firſt is true, therefore alſo the laſt. The <hi>Sequel</hi> of the <hi>Major</hi> is clear, becauſe this is the only pretence, upon which you ſuppoſe that all <hi>Scripture Truths</hi> may be, and yet compound no <hi>Religion,</hi> becauſe they may be, and yet no obligation be laid upon us to believe them. If therefore they cannot be, except an obligation be laid on us to believe them, then ſurely they cannot be, except they compound a <hi>Religion.</hi> It remaines therefore only that we prove the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> that they all cannot be revealed without an obligation to believe them, and this is cleare from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> cited in my <hi>Laſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> becauſe this is one of the <hi>Truths,</hi> in thoſe <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that we are obliged to believe theſe <hi>Truths.</hi> And I cited purpoſlie theſe <hi>Scripturs</hi> to prove this? And therfore it is impoſſible that all <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truths</hi> can be, and we not be obliged to believe them. For this is one <hi>Scripture truth,</hi> that we are obliged to believe the <hi>Truths</hi> revealed in <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> What now I have demonſtrated more prolixlie I ſet downe clearly enough, though more ſuccinctly, in my <hi>Laſt:</hi> Albeit it ſeemes you have been ſo taken up with your <hi>Precifive</hi> airie <hi>Notions,</hi> that you have not underſtood the Paper which was ſent to you. But to prevent your further miſtake in this, I thinke it fit to let you know, that I diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe two. I doe indeed confeſſe, that a <hi>Religion</hi> may be, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to <hi>Writing:</hi> And this was the caſe of the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> before <hi>Moſes:</hi> But this concernes not our preſent debate. But the thing I deny, is, <hi>That all the truths contained in Scripture, way be, and yet make no Religion at all.</hi> And this I hope now I have demonſtrated againſt you, both in this and in the former Paper: Though your <hi>Notional preciſions</hi> have made either your ſight or your judgement <hi>Preſeind</hi> from the <hi>Paper,</hi> which you ſhould have examined, and conſequently, from the purpoſe. By
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101081:130"/>theſe hints you may conſider, whether you have added any ſtrength to your inſignificant <hi>Objection, Concerning the ſenſe of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe you are ſtill harping upon this <hi>Cavil, About the ſenſe of the Scriptures.</hi> It would appear that you <hi>Looke upon Scripture as ſo obſcure, as not able to be a ground for deciſion of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in Religion, unleſs there be ſome infallible viſible-judge.</hi> I ſhall deſire you to conſider how different you are in your appreherſions, as to this matter, from the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> in which the deciſion of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies</hi> in Religion was committed, ſometime to <hi>Secular perſons,</hi> yea, ſometime to <hi>Heathens,</hi> which your ſelf will confeſſe not to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi> Have you not read that writing, which paſſeth under the name of <hi>Vigilius, Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> in which there is a diſpute betwixt <hi>Sabellius, Photinus,</hi> and <hi>Arius</hi> upon the one ſide, and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> on the other, concerning the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and <hi>Deitie of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> and <hi>Probus a Heathen</hi> is conſtituted judge to determine betwixt them, not according to his own fancy, but according to the proofes which they ſhould produce from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and after hearing of both, he gives ſentence for the <hi>Truth.</hi> This diſpute you will find ſet forth among <hi>Caſſanders works,</hi> from <hi>Page</hi> 460. and the ſentence of <hi>Probus</hi> the <hi>Judge, page</hi> 506. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I doe not ſay that this <hi>Conference</hi> was real, for the <hi>Collocutors</hi> were not contemporarie: Yet the Learned and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Author of this <hi>Dialogue,</hi> who by ſome is ſuppoſed to be <hi>Pope Galoſius,</hi> doth clearly inſinuate, that the moſt ſublime Myſteries of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> are ſo luculently revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that a meer <hi>Pagane</hi> may finde out the true ſenſe of Scripture concerning them.

                  </hi> is retorted by our Divines upon you, I believe you would have ſpared it. They ask where your <hi>Preſent
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:101081:134"/>Romiſh Religion,</hi> as now it ſtands, <hi>was before the council of Trent,</hi> which was confirmed by <hi>Pope Pius the fourth, Anno</hi> 1564. long after <hi>Luthers</hi> death? Our <hi>Divines</hi> know, that there were many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> before the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> againſt which the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> the <hi>Wickleviſts,</hi> the <hi>Huſſits, Luther</hi> and others did witnes. But the queſtion now is, <hi>Whether the then Church of Rome mantained all the points of Religion as neceſſary to Salvation, which your councill of Trent, and your Pope Pius the fourth, in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula fidei, have declared to be neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> If ſhe did, then you may be pleaſed to produce evidences hereof, wherein you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps finde more difficulty then you are awarre of. If ſhe did not, then is your preſent <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> a new upſtart, and <hi>Schiſmatical Church,</hi> of a diſtinct faith from the Catholick Church in all ages. You may notice how <hi>Doctor Field</hi> in the <hi>Appendix to his fifth booke, part.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. goes about, to prove that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not now the ſame that it was before <hi>Luthers</hi> appearance. Things being now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined as <hi>Articles of faith neceſſarie to Salvation,</hi> which were not ſo before. I ſincerely profeſſe the <hi>Noveltie</hi> of your <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Schiſmaticall conſtitution of your Church,</hi> are not the leaſt grounds of my diſatisfaction with your Religion, You may deſire your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> to calculate to you the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Canons,</hi> eſtablſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the points following as <hi>Articles of faith, viz, Firſt, The equality of unwriten traditions with the holy ſcriptures of GOD.</hi> 2. <hi>That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence in the regenerat is not properly ſinne.</hi> 3. <hi>The deſinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeven, properly ſo called Sacraments, neither more nor fewer.</hi> 4. <hi>The Popes ſupreamacie above general Councils.</hi> 5. <hi>Your Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and Purgatorie.</hi> 6. <hi>The abſtraction of the Cup from the people.</hi> 7. <hi>Your Tranſubstantiation.</hi> 8. <hi>The infallibility of the Church of Rome.</hi> 9. <hi>The adoration of Images.</hi> 10. <hi>The Popes juriſdiction over ſecular Princes.</hi> Not to mention more at the time.

                  </hi> of that goodly <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> which ye propoſed in your <hi>firſt Paper,</hi> wherein you ſaid, <hi>That the</hi> PROTESTANT <hi>Religion had no grounds to prove its conformity with the ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and to this day, you have been able to bring nothing in <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of it: Now therefore when <hi>Arguments</hi> fail you, you would try if you could bring your ſelf off, or creat <hi>Odium</hi> to your Adverſary, with a popular, but reallie impertinent <hi>Example.</hi> You ſay, <hi>That I have behaved my ſelf, as if one ſhould come as ſent from the Council, to require the Provest of Aberdene to apprehend a perſon ſuſpect of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie, but when the Provest did demand his commiſſion, he ſhould anſwere, that he was not bound to ſhow his Commiſſion, but his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was ſufficiently proven by this, that there could not be produced reaſons to ſhow that he had no Commiſſion.</hi> Is this the <hi>Scholaſtick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> which you call for, in ſtead of <hi>Arguments,</hi> to ſubſtitute po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, declamatorie, <hi>Scenick examples,</hi> which by a perſon of any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs, may be transformed into a thouſand various ſhapes? But ſeeing you will have the matter managed by <hi>Examples,</hi> I muſt <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſie</hi> time-about. Suppoſe therefore, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that a man were reallie Commiſſionated by the <hi>Secret Council,</hi> to require the <hi>Magiſtrats</hi> of ſuch a City to apprehend a diſloyal perſon, and for this effect did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> but the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> did cavil at the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>Commiſsion,</hi> how luculent ſoever in it ſelf, alleaging that they could doe nothing upon that <hi>Commiſsion</hi> untill the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it were cleared, and that the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it could not be cleared without an <hi>infallible Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Would not the <hi>Secret Council</hi> have juſt cauſe to be moved with
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101081:135"/>indignation againſt theſe <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who had ſo ludified their <hi>Order?</hi> And is not this the very caſe betwixt us and you? Doe not PROTESTANTS ſtill produce the <hi>Tables</hi> wherein the <hi>Ground</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> is contained, <hi>Viz,</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures?</hi> Doe not we tell you, if all our Religion be not found luculently there, we ſhall diſclaime it? Is not this your verie Cavil, that the <hi>Senſe of Scripture</hi> is ſo obſcure, that without an <hi>Infallible Bropounder</hi> it cannot be underſtood? Have you not cauſe then to feare the indignation of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> who doe thus reproach the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of GOD, and goe about to ſubvert the faith of his people, ſuſpending it till they get Propounders, of whoſe <hi>Infallibility</hi> they muſt have an Antecedent and previous aſſurance, whereas there are none ſuch now on Earth. The <hi>Fallibity</hi> of your <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> we did before demonſtrat, and you like a mute Advocat, had not a word to mutter for them. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> in the caſe which you propoſe, of a man pretending a <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and having none, and requiring the <hi>Magiſtrats</hi> to prove that he had none, therefore the <hi>Rogue</hi> is juſtly blameable, becauſe he refuſeth to prove the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> which was incumbent to him, and requires the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats</hi> to prove the <hi>Negative.</hi> But betwixt you and us the caſe is quite contrary. For though you framed the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> of your <hi>firſt Syllogiſme</hi> in <hi>Negative Termes,</hi> yet upon the matter, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to prove the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and required us to prove the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> For what is it for us to prove the <hi>Truth</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> in points controverted betwixt you and us, but to prove that there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now ſuppoſe that there were no Revelation from Heaven for <hi>Purgatorie, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice of the Maſſe,</hi> the <hi>Popes ſupreamacie, &amp;c.</hi> Will not you confeſs in that <hi>Caſe,</hi> that it were not duety to believe any of them, and that then it
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:101081:135"/>were a ſufficient Argument againſt them; there is no <hi>Divine revelation</hi> produceable for theſe things, therefore they are not to be believed: and if any would obtrude the belief of them upon others, that he were bound to produce a <hi>Divine revelation</hi> for them. Now we PROTESTANTS mantaine <hi>De facto,</hi> this to be the <hi>Caſe.</hi> I would therefore demand of any rational man, if there be a poſſibility to confute us, but by produceing a <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Divine revelation</hi> for theſe things? Are not you then guilty of the ſame <hi>Abſurditie</hi> with the <hi>Knave</hi> in your own <hi>Example,</hi> who refuſe to prove the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and require us to prove the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative?</hi> But yet further, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Is not he, at leaſt, bound to prove a <hi>Negative,</hi> who undertakes the <hi>Probation</hi> thereof? Should one undertake to prove, that ſuch an one had no <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from the <hi>Secret Council,</hi> would not his undertaking of this, oblige him to prove it? Seeing therefore by the <hi>Propoſal</hi> of your <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Syllogiſme,</hi> you undertake to prove the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> thereof; how can you deny that you are bound to prove them?

But our <hi>Divines</hi> deale liberally with you in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They ſtand nor upon words. They demand not the <hi>name of the number of ſeven.</hi> They only ask a real demonſtration of a <hi>preciſe ſeptenarie,</hi> though not in ſo many words. Hence <hi>Doctor Mortone,</hi> in the place laſt quoted: <hi>We exact not</hi> (ſayeth he,) <hi>the name of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeven, but only, as two and three make five, ſo would we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that any of the Fathers, in any place of their writings of the Sacraments of the New-Teſtament, did give any certaine intimation of the number of ſeven.</hi> Can PROTESTANTS be more condeſcending in their demands? Yet this could never be performed by any of you. A cleare evidence, that all your Popiſh Party cannot <hi>Proſelyte</hi> me to you in this point.

But by your deepe ſilence as to theſe, it is eaſie to gueſle, what ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is to be expected from you as to this. Nay <hi>Fourthly,</hi> is it not a meer <hi>Negative,</hi> whereof you demand the <hi>Probation</hi> from me, <hi>That there be only two Sacraments.</hi> For you ſay, <hi>It is not the probation of two,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:101081:138"/>but that there are no more then two,</hi> which you deſire, ſo that it is a meer <hi>Negative,</hi> you would have me proving: Now would not all the reaſon of the World ſay, that ye who mantaine the <hi>Affirmative, viz, that there be more then two, properly ſo called Gospel Sacraments, and that there be preciſely ſeven;</hi> Ought to prove this your <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> and that we are ſufficiently warranted to mantaine the <hi>Negative,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you prove the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> for <hi>Ab authoritate negativa, in rebus fidei, optima eſt conſequentia.</hi> You muſt alſo know, our <hi>Poſitives</hi> are the articles of our faith, and by the <hi>Negatives,</hi> which we mantaine in oppoſition to you, we declare that your errors are no part of our faith, ſo that when you lay the whole ſtreſſe upon your proving this <hi>Negative,</hi> that there are no more then <hi>two Sacraments,</hi> you doe not require us to prove an <hi>Article of our faith,</hi> nor ſhould we ſuccumb in proving <hi>an article of our faith,</hi> though we did not prove it. Our <hi>Negative</hi> is only a declaration, that your <hi>five ſuper added Sacraments</hi> are no part of <hi>our faith.</hi> But if you prove them not to be <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> you ſuccumb in proving <hi>an article of your Romiſh faith.</hi> How ſcurvily then deale you, who require us to prove the <hi>Negative,</hi> which is no <hi>article of our faith,</hi> and yet ſhunne to prove the <hi>contradictorie affirmative;</hi> which without queſtion is <hi>an article of your Romiſh faith.</hi> How little candor you have ſhewed in this matter, by theſe particulars may be diſcerned.</p>
               <p>Yet to give a touch of the <hi>Question</hi> in particulare, that the <hi>State</hi> thereof may be clear betwixt us, know that we doe not affirme, that the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> is to be found in Scripture; neither doe we deny, but in a large ſenſe, as ſome have taken it, <hi>pro ſigno rei ſacrae,</hi> for <hi>an holy ſigne,</hi> or <hi>the ſigne of an holy thing,</hi> which is the <hi>firſt definition</hi> given by <hi>Bellarmine, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Sacramentis in genere, cap.</hi> 11. out of <hi>Austine</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> it may be attributed to many things beſide <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> as to <hi>Chriſts waſhing of the Diſciples feet, to the holy kiſſe</hi> uſed in Scripture times, &amp;c.

For this only we meane by a <hi>proper Sacrament,</hi> when we affirme that there be only <hi>two.</hi> Though more ſhould be proven in another <hi>ſenſe,</hi> it would be but a <hi>Sophiſme, ab ignoratione elenchi;</hi> for the <hi>Concluſion</hi> would not be the <hi>contradictory</hi> of our <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is eaſily proven from <hi>Scripture,</hi> for it containes two branches, <hi>first,</hi> that there are <hi>two</hi> of that kinde of <hi>viſible ſignet.</hi> And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that there be <hi>only two</hi> and no more. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, for the <hi>poſitive part,</hi> that there be <hi>two,</hi> you your ſelf doe acknowledge, and if it were needful, it were eaſie to ſhew, that all the parts of the foreſaid <hi>Deſcription,</hi> doe agree to <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> For <hi>firſt,</hi> they are ſubſtantial viſible ſignes, inſtituted by GOD ſince the Incarnation, and their inſtitution is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Goſpel: You have the <hi>Divine inſtitution</hi> of <hi>baptizing</hi> with water, <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.19. And of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.24.25. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they are <hi>ſeals</hi> of the promiſes of ſalvation is no leſſe clear, and <hi>firſt</hi> of <hi>Baptiſme, Acts,</hi> 2.38.39. and alſo of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> in ſomuch that the <hi>Cup</hi> is called the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which you muſt acknowledge to be no proper ſpeach, but it is only ſo called, becauſe it is <hi>Sigillum faederis;</hi> hence alſo in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:101081:143"/>mention is made of the Remiſſion of ſinnes, and of the giving of the Body of CHRIST and ſhedding of his Blood for us, holding forth, that foregiveneſs of ſinnes, and all other bleſſings purchaſed by the Death of CHRIST, and promiſed in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> are by this <hi>Ordinance ſealed</hi> to the people of GOD. The <hi>third</hi> and <hi>last condition</hi> is no leſſe manifeſt, that theſe Ordinances are to continue to the end of World, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.

But (ſayeth he,) the words of the Parties may be conceived, either as a <hi>mutual tradition</hi> of the Parties to one another, &amp; thus they are the <hi>matter</hi> of the Sacrament; or as they are a <hi>mutual acceptation of the tradition</hi> made one by another, and thus they are the <hi>forme.</hi> This notion I finde likewiſe improven by divers others, <hi>Becan, Bonae Spei, &amp;c.</hi> And perhaps ſome favorite of <hi>Bellarmins,</hi> would in this ſenſe expound his affirming the words of the Parties, whereby they expreſſe their mutual conſent to be the <hi>matter</hi> of the Sacrament, <hi>in fieri.</hi> But grant he had meant ſo, yet it would advantage him nothing; for this likewiſe is another cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web of a <hi>Jeſuits</hi> braine.

Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdot. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>num.</hi> 2. mentions three differences betwixt them, <hi>viz, First, That Marriage in the Christian Church, is a Sacrament, not ſo among either Iewes or Heathens.</hi> But all ſee that to be a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the <hi>queſtion,</hi> therefore I let it goe. <hi>Secondly, That Marriage in the Goſpel Church conferrs grace, ex opere operato.</hi> And <hi>Thirdly, That in the Gospel Church, actus conjugalis eſt meritorius, the conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal act,</hi> (They who are acquaint with your <hi>Ieſuit Dialect,</hi> will underſtand his meaning, I am aſhamed to make it plainer,) <hi>Is meritorious, not ſo among Heathens, or ancient Iewes,</hi> Theſe things the <hi>Ieſuit</hi> boldly aſſerts, but doth not once offer a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for them. They might be ſolidly confuted, (but that I doubt I be alreadie guilty of too too much prolixity,) by all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which our Divines bring againſt your <hi>opus operatum</hi> in the general, and againſt your doctrine of Merite, all which hold, a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori,</hi> in this particular. Hither if in any caſe I may apply that ſaying,
<q>O Spes fallaces Meritis confidere vanis!</q>

               <p>I ſhall only deſire you, if you dare owne theſe <hi>impious poſitions</hi> of your fellow <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> to try how you can bring any ſhadow of reaſon why <hi>Marriage</hi> doth conferre grace, <hi>ex opere operato?</hi> Or why <hi>conjugal acts</hi> are <hi>meritorious,</hi> now among <hi>Christians,</hi> and not of old among <hi>believing Iewes?</hi> Are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now in a ſtate of Grace, ſo were <hi>believing Iewes?</hi> Have <hi>Chriſtians</hi> now a reſpect to the ends why Marriage was inſtituted, ſo had believing <hi>Iewes?</hi> Where then is the difference as to the ſpecifick nature of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance then &amp; now? But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If <hi>Marriage</hi> be a proper <hi>Goſpel Sacrament,</hi> how are your <hi>Prieſts</hi> interdyted from it? Doth one <hi>Sarcrament</hi> render perſons incapable of another? How did <hi>Siricius</hi> and <hi>Innocent the firſt, Biſhops of Rome,</hi> paſſe ſuch an <hi>impious gloſſe</hi> (if the <hi>Deeretals</hi> aſcribed to them be genuin) upon that text

If this gloſſe were true, marriage were ſo farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering grace <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi> and conjugall acts ſo farre from being meritorious, that they ſhould rather put a perſon in a ſtate of enmity againſt GOD, which to affirme, ſayes the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.3. <hi>Were a doctrine of Devils. Fifthly,</hi> how can it be made out, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> is appointed of GOD as a <hi>Seal of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Salvation? Doth not your own <hi>Caſſander</hi> aſſirme, that your <hi>Maſter of ſentences Lombard, denyeth Marriage to conferre Grace,</hi> which you <hi>Romaniſts</hi> require as neceſſary to the nature of a proper <hi>Gospell Sacrament?

Ungo te oleo in nomine Patris,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, is it not debated among you, whether there be any command at all for receiving this pretended <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Extreme Unction?</hi> Are not the greateſt part of your <hi>Doctors</hi> for the <hi>Negative?</hi> Hear your own <hi>Suarez, tem.</hi> 4. <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>part. diſp.</hi> 44. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 2. <hi>Communis</hi> (ſayeth he,) <hi>opinio eſt nullum eſſe affirmativum praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum de ſuſcipiendo hoc ſacramento, etiam in extremo vitae diſcrimine.</hi> That is, <hi>It is the commone opinion of the Romiſh Divines, that there is no poſitive precept obliging perſons to receive this ſacrament of extreme unction, even when they are in the moſt extreme hazard of death.</hi> A noble Sacrament indeed, which by the confeſſion of your own <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> ye are tyed by no command of GOD to receive. The ſame is granted by your <hi>Romiſh Doctors,</hi> concerning all your <hi>five</hi> controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Sacraments,</hi> except <hi>Pennance.</hi> That there is no poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of GOD to receive any of them. Whence I argue thus. There are poſitive precepts in the holy Scripture for receiving <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>LORDS-Supper,</hi> but there is no poſitive precept of GOD, either in or our of Scripture, for receiving <hi>foure</hi> at leaſt of your <hi>Sacraments,</hi> viz. <hi>Confirmation, Marriage, extreme Unction,</hi> and <hi>Ordination;</hi> as is confeſſed by your own <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> Therefore, theſe <hi>foure</hi> at leaſt are no ſuch <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords-Supper.</hi> And though your intereſt and <hi>Commodum Curiae,</hi> induces you to aſſert a neceſſity of <hi>Pennance,</hi> (for thereby you make your ſelves Maſters, both of <hi>Purſes</hi> and <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and privie to all <hi>Secrets,</hi>) yet try when you will, you
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101081:151"/>will be as little able ſolidly to prove a poſitive command of GOD for <hi>Pennance,</hi> in your <hi>Romiſh ſenſe,</hi> and as it is practiſed among you, as for any of the other foure. And conſequently, none of theſe your <hi>five Sacraments</hi> is <hi>ſub pracepto,</hi> and therefore none of them are ſuch <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as are <hi>BAPTISME and the</hi> LORDS SUPPER; which is that which PROTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTS meane, when they affirme that there be <hi>only two properly ſo called Sacraments of the New Teſtament. Fourthly,</hi> not only have our Divines proven, that the <hi>two places of Scripture</hi> which <hi>Romanists</hi> deprave for this pretended <hi>Sacrament,</hi> viz, <hi>Marke,</hi> 6.13. and <hi>Iames</hi> 5.14.15. make nothing for you: But alſo eminent <hi>Authours</hi> among your ſelves have done the ſame.

               <p>Perhaps I have expatiated on theſe particulars too farre, I ſhall now leave you to examine <hi>ſeven</hi> other <hi>Sacraments,</hi> (as a learned <hi>Authour</hi> termes them,) or rather <hi>Myſteries of iniquity,</hi> which <hi>Doctor Beard</hi> in his <hi>Retractive from Poperie,</hi> hath charged upon <hi>your Church, viz, Turpitudinem: Impietatem, Falſitatem, Novitatem, Idololatriam, Scripturarum Vituperationem, &amp; Ignorantiae Defenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> That is, <hi>Turpitude, Impiety, Falſhood, Novelty, Idolatrie, Reproaching of the Scriptures, and Patrociny of Ignorance.</hi> How juſtly theſe are charged upon your Church, I leave you to receive:

               <p>I ſhut up this whole diſcourſe, concerning the <hi>number of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> with two teſtimonies from your famous <hi>Caſſander, in Conſult. art</hi> 13. <hi>de Numero Sacramentorum,</hi> which I ſuppoſe may ſtop the mouths of <hi>your Romaniſts,</hi> and if you would lay aſide a contending Humor, might doe much to put a <hi>period</hi> to this <hi>Question.</hi> His firſt <hi>teſtimony</hi> is this, <hi>In hoe certè controverſia nulla eſt, duo eſſe praecipua ſalutis noſtrae Sacramenta, quomode lequuntur</hi> Rupertus Tuitien ſis; <hi>&amp;</hi> Hugo de Sancto Victore, <hi>nempe ſacrum Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſma, &amp; Sacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Corporis, &amp; Sanguinis Domini.</hi> That is, <hi>There is no controverſie concerning this, that there be two chief Sacraments of our Salvation, as</hi> Rupertus Tuitienſis, <hi>and</hi> Hugo de Sancto Victore <hi>doe speake, namely, holy Baptiſme, and the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of the LORD.</hi> The other <hi>teſtimony of Caſſander</hi> followes a little after, thus. <hi>Et de his quoque ſeptem Sacramentis certum eſt, ne ipſes quidem ſcholaſticos exiſtimaſſe omnia aeque proprie Sacramenta vocari.</hi> That is, <hi>Concerning the ſeven</hi> much talked <hi>of Sacraments, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> (ſayeth <hi>Caſſander,</hi>) <hi>that the ſchool-men themſelves never eſteemed them all alike properly ſo called Sacraments.</hi> What can I, or an indifferent <hi>Reader</hi> conclude from theſe <hi>teſtimonies of Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> but that you <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are convinced in your own <hi>conſciences.</hi> that there are no other ordinances which may be termed <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in that ſtrict <hi>notion</hi> wherein <hi>Baptiſme and the Lords Supper</hi> may, which is that which PROTESTANTS affirme.</p>
               <p>Yet that you may remember, that you are not liberated from your old task, but remain where ye were at the <hi>tranſmiſſion</hi> of your firſt <hi>Paper</hi> to me. I ſubioyne againe the confutation of all your <hi>ten Papers</hi> in theſe <hi>two words.</hi>
